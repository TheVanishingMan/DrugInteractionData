        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release VIRAMUNE are expected to also apply to VIRAMUNE XR. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology , Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between immediate-release VIRAMUNE and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release VIRAMUNE are expected to also apply to VIRAMUNE XR. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex , overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be increased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE XR can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking VIRAMUNE XR is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) Pediatric patients: The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in VIRAMUNE XR clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with VIRAMUNE XR and 654 subjects treated with immediate release VIRAMUNE. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or VIRAMUNE XR 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release VIRAMUNE group and 6% in the VIRAMUNE XR group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release VIRAMUNE group and VIRAMUNE XR group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release VIRAMUNE (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release VIRAMUNE or VIRAMUNE XR after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Selected Clinical Adverse Drug Reactions* of at least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or above) Occurring in 2% or more of Adult Subjects- Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.14861 * Excludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs 1 Mean observation period 98 weeks. 2 Rash includes terms rash, rash maculo-papular, erythema nodosum, rash erythematous, rash papular, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). 3 Clinical hepatitis includes terms hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis acute, liver disorder, hepatitis toxic, hepatic failure, jaundice.

Adverse reactions observed for VIRAMUNE XR subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 1. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were assessed in Trial 1100.1518, an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, cross-over trial to evaluate the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of VIRAMUNE XR tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age. Safety was further examined in an optional extension phase of the trial. Forty subjects who completed the pharmacokinetic part of the trial were treated with VIRAMUNE XR once daily in combination with other antiretrovirals for a median duration of 33 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to VIRAMUNE XR in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. In pediatric subjects the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. There were no adverse reactions of Grade 2 or above which were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator that occurred in more than 1% of subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release VIRAMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, prior to initiation of VIRAMUNE XR (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of VIRAMUNE XR therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE XR treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) ]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release VIRAMUNE twice daily who switch to VIRAMUNE XR therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release VIRAMUNE in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of VIRAMUNE XR for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. VIRAMUNE XR has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release VIRAMUNE daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate VIRAMUNE XR if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release VIRAMUNE lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release VIRAMUNE lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release VIRAMUNE, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance VIRAMUNE XR must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE XR, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology(12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in nevirapine extended-release clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with nevirapine extended-release and 654 subjects treated with immediate release nevirapine. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or nevirapine extended-release 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release nevirapine group and 6% in the nevirapine extended-release group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release nevirapine group and nevirapine extended-release group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release nevirapine, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release nevirapine (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release nevirapine or nevirapine extended-release after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Selected Clinical Adverse Drug Reactions* of at least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or above) Occurring in 2% or more of Adult Subjects- Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.14861 * Excludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs 1 Mean observation period 98 weeks. 2 Rash includes terms rash, rash maculo-papular, erythema nodosum, rash erythematous, rash papular, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). 3 Clinical hepatitis includes terms hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis acute, liver disorder, hepatitis toxic, hepatic failure, jaundice.

Adverse reactions observed for nevirapine extended-release subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were assessed in Trial 1100.1518, an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, cross-over trial to evaluate the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine extended-release tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age. Safety was further examined in an optional extension phase of the trial. Forty subjects who completed the pharmacokinetic part of the trial were treated with nevirapine extended-release once daily in combination with other antiretrovirals for a median duration of 33 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to nevirapine extended-release in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. In pediatric subjects the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. There were no adverse reactions of Grade 2 or above which were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator that occurred in more than 1% of subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5,5.6) The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, prior to initiation of nevirapine extended-release (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of nevirapine extended-release therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine extended-release treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release nevirapine twice daily who switch to nevirapine extended-release therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release nevirapine, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine extended-release for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nevirapine extended-release has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release nevirapine daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate nevirapine extended-release tablets if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release nevirapine lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release nevirapine lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release nevirapine, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine extended-release must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine extended-release, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/ Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir, with respect to safety and efficacy, have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics : Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics : Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants : Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between immediate-release nevirapine tablets and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release nevirapine tablets are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) ( nevirapine ) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Co-administration of nevirapine extended-release tablets can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking nevirapine extended-release tablets is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.2)]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in nevirapine extended-release clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with nevirapine extended-release and 654 subjects treated with immediate-release nevirapine. Trial 1100.1486 ( VERxVE ) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or nevirapine extended-release 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release nevirapine group and 6% in the nevirapine extended-release group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release nevirapine group and in the nevirapine extended-release group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release nevirapine, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial, all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release nevirapine (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release nevirapine or nevirapine extended-release after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 1.

Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed in subjects receiving nevirapine extended-release. Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue therapy with nevirapine in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Laboratory abnormalities that occurred in trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2.

Adverse reactions observed for nevirapine extended-release subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 1. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) ( nevirapine ) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole : fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary : jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic : paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, prior to initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of nevirapine extended-release therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine extended-release tablets treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2, 2.5)]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release nevirapine twice daily who switch to nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. - Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) - Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria , acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see BOXED WARNING, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release nevirapine, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine extended-release tablets for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4.2 )]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.1), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Nevirapine extended-release tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see BOXED WARNING]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release nevirapine daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate nevirapine extended-release tablets if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release nevirapine lead-in period of 200 mg/day until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release nevirapine lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release nevirapine, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) ( nevirapine ) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine extended-release tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine extended-release tablets, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see MICROBIOLOGY (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 )]. Concomitant use of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's Wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's Wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology , Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Atazanavir/Ritonavir | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure. Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex , overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Efavirenz | Efavirenz There has been no determination of appropriate doses for the safe and effective use of this combination [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Fluconazole |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Fosamprenavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. Indinavir | Indinavir Appropriate doses for this combination are not established, but an increase in the dosage of indinavir may be required. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Lopinavir/Ritonavir |Lopinavir Lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg tablets can be used twice daily in combination with nevirapine with no dose adjustment in antiretroviral-naive patients. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 600/150 mg (3 tablets) twice daily may be considered when used in combination with nevirapine in treatment-experienced patients where decreased susceptibility to lopinavir is clinically suspected (by treatment history or laboratory evidence). A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. In children 6 months to 12 years of age, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 13/3.25 mg/kg for those 7 to <15 kg; 11/2.75 mg/kg for those 15 to 45 kg; and up to a maximum dose of 533/133 mg for those >45 kg twice daily when used in combination with nevirapine, particularly for patients in whom reduced susceptibility to lopinavir/ritonavir is suspected. Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Nelfinavir |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate dose for nelfinavir in combination with nevirapine, with respect to safety and efficacy, has not been established. Rifabutin |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between VIRAMUNE and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Potential Drug Interactions: Drug Class Examples of Drugs Antiarrhythmics Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antifungals Itraconazole Plasma concentrations of some azole antifungals may be decreased. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to a potential decrease in itraconazole plasma concentrations. Calcium channel blockers Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Cancer chemotherapy Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Ergot alkaloids Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Immunosuppressants Cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Motility agents Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Opiate agonists Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antithrombotics Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 14.8% vs 5.9% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 1.5% of patients (6.1) In pediatric patients the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials in Adults The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4.0% (range 0% to 11.0%) of patients who received VIRAMUNE and 1.2% of patients in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (>250 cells/mm3 in women and >400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT >5X ULN) were observed in 5.8% (range 0% to 9.2%) of patients who received VIRAMUNE and 5.5% of patients in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in patients receiving VIRAMUNE than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of VIRAMUNE is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13.3% of patients receiving VIRAMUNE compared to 5.8% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1.5% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to 0.1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of VIRAMUNE-associated rash [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in >2% of patients receiving VIRAMUNE in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Patients with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all patients and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Patients had CD4+ cell counts <200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; VIRAMUNE monotherapy was administered in some patients. Patients had CD4+ cell count >=200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue VIRAMUNE therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing VIRAMUNE and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Patients with Laboratory Abnormalities 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all patients and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Patients had CD4+ cell counts <200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; VIRAMUNE monotherapy was administered in some patients. Patients had CD4+ cell count > 200 cells/mm3.

In this trial two patients were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of VIRAMUNE (n=37) in which patients were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these patients in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to VIRAMUNE in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and VIRAMUNE. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of VIRAMUNE was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical study performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive patients between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with VIRAMUNE oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the patients, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 patients experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (<4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (8.9%), anemia (7.3%) and hepatotoxicity (2.4%) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of VIRAMUNE in combination therapy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to <3 months of age was assessed in 36 patients from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) study. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Surveillance In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRAMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue or significant hepatic abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy and/or renal dysfunction have been reported with the use of VIRAMUNE. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, would include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with VIRAMUNE 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Hepatitis and hepatic failure (5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome (5) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (5) Hypersensitivity reactions (5) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with VIRAMUNE. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11.0%) of patients who received VIRAMUNE and 1.2% of patients in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the VIRAMUNE groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue VIRAMUNE and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, VIRAMUNE should be permanently discontinued. Do not restart VIRAMUNE after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a three-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8% versus 2.2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of VIRAMUNE therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with VIRAMUNE. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0% versus 0.9%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts >400 cells/mm3 (6.3% versus 1.2% for men with CD4+ cell counts <400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of VIRAMUNE in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis, an unapproved use. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis should be monitored carefully for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Nevirapine should not be administered to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 1.5% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to 0.1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Do not restart VIRAMUNE following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected VIRAMUNE-associated rash, transaminases should be measured immediately. Patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations should be permanently discontinued from VIRAMUNE [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with VIRAMUNE must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. VIRAMUNE should be discontinued if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. A patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) should not have their VIRAMUNE dose increased until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period should not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients should be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping VIRAMUNE treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with VIRAMUNE. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent VIRAMUNE-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance VIRAMUNE must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than VIRAMUNE are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or St. John's wort-containing products and VIRAMUNE is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including VIRAMUNE, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of VIRAMUNE and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to VIRAMUNE or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRAMUNE. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Ltd. at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037,1038,1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for the development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 1090Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037 , 1038 , 1046Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2). Table 2. Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory Abnormality Trial 1090Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/ accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through the 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminases elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg.per.day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in-dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash, is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between Nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant drug Clinical Comment Atazanavir/Ritonavir | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure. Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Efavirenz | Efavirenz There has been no determination of appropriate doses for the safe and effective use of this combination [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended Fluconazole |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine- associated adverse events. Fosamprenavir |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. Indinavir | Indinavir Appropriate doses for this combination are not established, but an increase in the dosage of indinavir may be required. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Lopinavir/Ritonavir |Lopinavir A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500/125 mg twice-daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. In children 6 months to 12 years of age receiving lopinavir/ritonavir solution, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 13/3.25 mg/kg for those 7 to <15 kg; 11/2.75 mg/kg for those 15 to 45 kg; up to a maximum dose of 533/133 mg twice daily. Refer to the lopinavir/ritonavir package insert for complete pediatric dosing instructions when lopinavir/ritonavir tablets are used in combination with nevirapine. Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone- maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Nelfinavir |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate dose for nelfinavir in combination with nevirapine, with respect to safety and efficacy, has not been established. Rifabutin |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between Nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Potential Drug Interactions Drug Class Examples of Drugs Antiarrhythmics Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antifungals Itraconazole Plasma concentrations of some azole antifungals may be decreased. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to a potential decrease in itraconazole plasma concentrations. Calcium channel blockers Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Cancer chemotherapy Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Ergot alkaloids Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Immunosuppressants Cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Motility agents Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Opiate agonists Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antithrombotics Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Co-administration of NEVIRAPINE can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% vs 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or www.amneal.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials in Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of Nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving Nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of Nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving Nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue Nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing Nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo Laboratory Abnormality (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Blood Chemistry SGPT (ALT) >250 U/L 5 4 14 4 SGOT (AST) >250 U/L 4 3 8 2 Bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL 2 2 2 2 Hematology Hemoglobin <8 g/dL 3 4 0 0 Platelets <50,000/mm3 1 1 <1 2 Neutrophils <750/mm3 13 14 4 1 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Nevirapine (n=305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with Nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of Nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to Nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and Nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of Nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with Nevirapine oral suspension, lamuvidine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%) and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of Nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions(5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with Nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout Nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with Nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactins occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the Nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue Nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue Nevirapine. Do not restart Nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3- fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of Nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with Nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of Nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reaction Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue Nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Do not restart Nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected Nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue Nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with Nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue Nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase Nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping Nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with Nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of Nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent Nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing Nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than Nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John\"s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John\"s wort-containing products and Nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including Nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of Nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of Nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between Nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* Rifabutin* Rifampin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin | Rifabutin | Nevirapine Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* Ketoconazole* Itraconazole |Nevirapine | Ketoconazole | Itraconazole Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between Nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) -In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (855) 724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2 )]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2). Table 2 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo Laboratory Abnormality (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Blood Chemistry SGPT (ALT) >250 U/L 5 4 14 4 SGOT (AST) >250 U/L 4 3 8 2 Bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL 2 2 2 2 Hematology Hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL 3 4 0 0 Platelets <50,000/mm3 1 1 <1 2 Neutrophils <750/mm3 13 14 4 1 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nevirapine (n=305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorous Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . -Hepatotoxicity:Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5 , 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillian-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between VIRAMUNE and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving VIRAMUNE than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of VIRAMUNE is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving VIRAMUNE compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of VIRAMUNE-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving VIRAMUNE in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; VIRAMUNE monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 VIRAMUNE Placebo VIRAMUNE Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving VIRAMUNE than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue VIRAMUNE therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing VIRAMUNE and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; VIRAMUNE monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of VIRAMUNE (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to VIRAMUNE in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and VIRAMUNE. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of VIRAMUNE was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with VIRAMUNE oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of VIRAMUNE in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRAMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with VIRAMUNE 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with VIRAMUNE. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the VIRAMUNE groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue VIRAMUNE and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE. Do not restart VIRAMUNE after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of VIRAMUNE therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with VIRAMUNE. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of VIRAMUNE in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of VIRAMUNE for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning]. Do not restart VIRAMUNE following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected VIRAMUNE-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with VIRAMUNE must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue VIRAMUNE if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase VIRAMUNE dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping VIRAMUNE treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with VIRAMUNE. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent VIRAMUNE-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance VIRAMUNE must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than VIRAMUNE are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and VIRAMUNE is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including VIRAMUNE, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of VIRAMUNE and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to VIRAMUNE or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRAMUNE. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine |Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* |Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* Rifabutin* Rifampin* |Clarithromycin |14-OH clarithromycin |Rifabutin | Nevirapine Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium­intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* Ketoconazole* Itraconazole |Nevirapine | Ketoconazole | Itraconazole Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus. 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3).

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non­-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine . Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/ Ritonavir* ¯ Atazanavir ­ Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* ¯Amprenavir ­Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/ Ritonavir* ¯Amprenavir ­Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* ¯ Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/ Ritonavir* ¯Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight.Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* ¯Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite ¯Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ Ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of and nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* ¯ Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may be may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* ¯ Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* ¯ Clarithromycin ­14-OH clarithromyci Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* ­Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Rifampin* ¯ Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* ­Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* ¯ Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole ¯ Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potentia decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* ¯Ethinyl estradiol ¯ Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS - The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) - In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1.

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (Table 2). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2).

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nevirapine (n = 305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%) and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. - Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) - Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or persensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) - Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine.During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Grave's disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome)have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine |Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* |Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* Rifabutin* Rifampin* |Clarithromycin |14-OH clarithromycin |Rifabutin | Nevirapine Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* Ketoconazole* Itraconazole |Nevirapine | Ketoconazole | Itraconazole Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interations shown are predicted. Co-administration of Nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy(5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 14.8% vs 5.9% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 1.5% of patients (6.1) -In pediatric patients the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GSMS, Inc. at 1-800-284-8633 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ofa drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11.%) of patients who received nevirapine and 1% of patients in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (>250 cells/mm3 in women and >400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT >5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of patients who received nevirapine and 5.5% of patients in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in patients receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of patients receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of patients receiving Nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 10901 Trial 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 1Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cell/mm3. 2Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV=ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in patients receiving nevirapine than in controls (Table 2). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2).

Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cell/mm3. 2Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV=ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nevirapine (n=305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with Nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, would include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout Nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with Nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11.0%) of patients who received Nevirapine and 1.2% of patients in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the Nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue Nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart Nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a three-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8% versus 2.2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of Nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with Nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts >400 cells/mm3 (6.3% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts <400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis, an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not be administered nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue Nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Do not restart Nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue niverapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with Nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping Nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with Nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of Nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's Wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) -In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4: Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/RitonavirThe interaction between immediate-release nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700 mg/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500 mg/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533 mg/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be co-administered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be co-administered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be co-administered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine extended-release tablets can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking nevirapine extended-release tablets is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) -Pediatric patients: The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in nevirapine extended-release tablets clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets and 654 subjects treated with immediate release nevirapine. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n = 1,068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (n = 506) or nevirapine extended-release tablets 400 mg once daily (n = 505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release nevirapine group and 6% in the nevirapine extended-release tablets group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release nevirapine group and nevirapine extended-release tablets group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release nevirapine, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release nevirapine (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release nevirapine or nevirapine extended-release tablets after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Selected Clinical Adverse Drug ReactionsExcludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs of At Least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or Above) Occurring in 2% or More of Adult Subjects - Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.1486Mean observation period 98 weeks.

Adverse reactions observed for nevirapine extended-release tablets subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were assessed in Trial 1100.1518, an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine extended-release tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age. Safety was further examined in an optional extension phase of the trial. Forty subjects who completed the pharmacokinetic part of the trial were treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets once daily in combination with other antiretrovirals for a median duration of 33 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to nevirapine extended-release tablets in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. In pediatric subjects the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. There were no adverse reactions of Grade 2 or above which were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator that occurred in more than 1% of subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, prior to initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets (during the lead-in period), and at 2 weeks after initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine extended-release tablets treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release nevirapine twice daily who switch to nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release nevirapine, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine extended-release tablets for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nevirapine extended-release tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release nevirapine daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate nevirapine extended-release tablets if a patient experiences a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release nevirapine lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release nevirapine lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release nevirapine, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine extended-release tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross-resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine extended-release tablets, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in , Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. Clinical Pharmacology The interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. in vitro Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. The interaction between VIRAMUNE and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. * Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. (R) Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir C min The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against , overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Anticonvulsants: Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Warfarin Antithrombotics: Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Calcium channel blockers: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cyclophosphamide Cancer chemotherapy: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergotamine Ergot alkaloids: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Immunosuppressants: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cisapride Motility agents: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Fentanyl Opiate agonists: Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. , , (5.4 7 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction . [see and Warnings and Precautions , ] Boxed Warning (5.1 5.2) Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4 cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm in women and greater than 400 cells/mm in men) place patients at increased risk of these events . + 3 3 [see and Warnings and Precautions ] Boxed Warning (5.1) Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving VIRAMUNE than in controls (see ). Table 3 Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of VIRAMUNE is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening . Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving VIRAMUNE compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of VIRAMUNE-associated rash . [see and Warnings and Precautions ] Boxed Warning (5.2) [see and Warnings and Precautions ] Boxed Warning (5.2) Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving VIRAMUNE in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue VIRAMUNE therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing VIRAMUNE and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of VIRAMUNE (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to VIRAMUNE in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and VIRAMUNE. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of VIRAMUNE was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with VIRAMUNE oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks . Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) . [see Use In Specific Populations and Clinical Pharmacology ] (8.4) (12.3) [see Use in Specific Populations and Clinical Studies ] (8.4) (14.2) Safety information on use of VIRAMUNE in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRAMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal , redistribution/accumulation of body fat Body as a Whole: [see Drug Interactions ] (7) [see Warnings and Precautions ] (5.6) vomiting Gastrointestinal: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Liver and Biliary: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Hematology: decreased serum phosphorus Investigations: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Musculoskeletal: paraesthesia Neurologic: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. Skin and Appendages: [see Warnings and Precautions ] (5.1) In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with VIRAMUNE are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with VIRAMUNE 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash . The first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. [see Dosage and Administration ] (2.1) Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. , (5.5 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with VIRAMUNE. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received VIRAMUNE and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the VIRAMUNE groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue VIRAMUNE and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. . Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see and Dosage and Administration ] Boxed Warning (2.3) If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE. Do not restart VIRAMUNE after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4 cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4 cell counts at initiation of VIRAMUNE therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with VIRAMUNE. In a retrospective review, women with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4 cell counts less than 250 cells/mm (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm (6% versus 1% for men with CD4 cell counts less than 400 cells/mm ). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4 cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4 cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. + + + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + + In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of VIRAMUNE in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of VIRAMUNE for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated . [see Contraindications ] (4.2) Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment . [see Contraindications , Use in Specific Populations , and Clinical Pharmacology ] (4.1) (8.7) (12.3) 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with VIRAMUNE use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of VIRAMUNE recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE and seek medical evaluation immediately . Do not restart VIRAMUNE following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. [see ] Boxed Warning If patients present with a suspected VIRAMUNE-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue VIRAMUNE in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations . [see Warnings and Precautions ] (5.1) Therapy with VIRAMUNE must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue VIRAMUNE if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase VIRAMUNE dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m /day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought . Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping VIRAMUNE treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. 2 2 [see Dosage and Administration ] (2.4) Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with VIRAMUNE. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent VIRAMUNE-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance VIRAMUNE must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than VIRAMUNE are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop . [see Microbiology ] (12.4) 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions . [see Drug Interactions ] (7) Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( ) or St. John's wort-containing products and VIRAMUNE is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including VIRAMUNE, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of VIRAMUNE and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to VIRAMUNE or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. Hypericum perforatum 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRAMUNE. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Mycobacterium avium Pneumocystis jiroveci Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release VIRAMUNE are expected to also apply to VIRAMUNE XR. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology , Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. * The interaction between immediate-release VIRAMUNE and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release VIRAMUNE are expected to also apply to VIRAMUNE XR. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE XR can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking VIRAMUNE XR is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) Pediatric patients: The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] . The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in VIRAMUNE XR clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with VIRAMUNE XR and 654 subjects treated with immediate release VIRAMUNE. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or VIRAMUNE XR 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release VIRAMUNE group and 6% in the VIRAMUNE XR group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release VIRAMUNE group and VIRAMUNE XR group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release VIRAMUNE (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release VIRAMUNE or VIRAMUNE XR after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Selected Clinical Adverse Drug Reactions* of at least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or above) Occurring in 2% or more of Adult Subjects- Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.14861 * Excludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs 1 Mean observation period 98 weeks. 2 Rash includes terms rash, rash maculo-papular, erythema nodosum, rash erythematous, rash papular, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). 3 Clinical hepatitis includes terms hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis acute, liver disorder, hepatitis toxic, hepatic failure, jaundice.

Adverse reactions observed for VIRAMUNE XR subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were assessed in Trial 1100.1518, an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, cross-over trial to evaluate the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of VIRAMUNE XR tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age. Safety was further examined in an optional extension phase of the trial. Forty subjects who completed the pharmacokinetic part of the trial were treated with VIRAMUNE XR once daily in combination with other antiretrovirals for a median duration of 33 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to VIRAMUNE XR in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. In pediatric subjects the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. There were no adverse reactions of Grade 2 or above which were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator that occurred in more than 1% of subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release VIRAMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)] , redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, prior to initiation of VIRAMUNE XR (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of VIRAMUNE XR therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE XR treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release VIRAMUNE has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)] . Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release VIRAMUNE twice daily who switch to VIRAMUNE XR therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release VIRAMUNE in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of VIRAMUNE XR for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)] . Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . VIRAMUNE XR has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning] . Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release VIRAMUNE daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate VIRAMUNE XR if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release VIRAMUNE lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release VIRAMUNE lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release VIRAMUNE, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance VIRAMUNE XR must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE XR, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)] . 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* |Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* |Clarithromycin |14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* |Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* |Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole |Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* |Ethinyl estradiol |Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine (n=1121) Placebo (n=1128) Nevirapine (n=253) Placebo (n=203) 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory Abnormality Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine (n=1121) Placebo (n=1128) Nevirapine (n=253) Placebo (n=203) 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non­-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine . Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. *The interaction between Nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is coadministered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir C min The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between Nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadonemaintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* Rifabutin* Rifampin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin | Rifabutin | Nevirapine Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients coinfected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* Ketoconazole* Itraconazole | Nevirapine | Ketoconazole | Itraconazole Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* |Ethinyl estradiol |Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy ( 5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects ( 6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% ( 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Carlsbad Tech at 1 (855) 397-9777 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4 + cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4 + cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4 + cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls ( Table 2). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2). Table 2 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4 + cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4 + cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2) ]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions ( 7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorous Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1) ]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. ( 5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. ( 5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution ( 5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2.3) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4 + cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4 + cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4 + cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4 + cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4 + cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4 + cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4 + cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4 + cell counts. Coinfection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV- 1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications ( 4.1), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology ( 12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions ( 7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and t reatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillian-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology , Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4: Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/RitonavirThe interaction between immediate-release nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700 mg/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500 mg/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533 mg/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be co-administered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be co-administered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be co-administered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine extended-release tablets can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking nevirapine extended-release tablets is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) -Pediatric patients: The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in nevirapine extended-release tablets clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets and 654 subjects treated with immediate release nevirapine. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n = 1,068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (n = 506) or nevirapine extended-release tablets 400 mg once daily (n = 505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release nevirapine group and 6% in the nevirapine extended-release tablets group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release nevirapine group and nevirapine extended-release tablets group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release nevirapine, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release nevirapine (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release nevirapine or nevirapine extended-release tablets after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Selected Clinical Adverse Drug ReactionsExcludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs of At Least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or Above) Occurring in 2% or More of Adult Subjects - Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.1486Mean observation period 98 weeks.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue therapy with nevirapine in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Laboratory abnormalities that occurred in trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 3.

Adverse reactions observed for nevirapine extended-release tablets subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were assessed in Trial 1100.1518, an open-label, multiple-dose, non-randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine extended-release tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age. Safety was further examined in an optional extension phase of the trial. Forty subjects who completed the pharmacokinetic part of the trial were treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets once daily in combination with other antiretrovirals for a median duration of 33 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to nevirapine extended-release tablets in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults. In pediatric subjects the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash was 1%. There were no adverse reactions of Grade 2 or above which were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator that occurred in more than 1% of subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, prior to initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets (during the lead-in period), and at 2 weeks after initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine extended-release tablets treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release nevirapine twice daily who switch to nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release nevirapine, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine extended-release tablets for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Nevirapine extended-release tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release nevirapine daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate nevirapine extended-release tablets if a patient experiences a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release nevirapine lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release nevirapine lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release nevirapine, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine extended-release tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross-resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine extended-release tablets, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release nevirapine tablets are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.

The results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release nevirapine tablets are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients:A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine tablets, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking nevirapine extended-release tablet is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in nevirapine extended-release tablets clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with nevirapine extended-release tablets and 654 subjects treated with immediate release nevirapine tablets. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate-release nevirapine tablets 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate-release nevirapine tablets 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or nevirapine extended-release tablet 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate-release nevirapine tablets group and 6% in the nevirapine extended-release tablets group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate-release nevirapine tablets group and nevirapine extended-release tablets group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate-release nevirapine tablets and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate-release nevirapine tablet (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate-release nevirapine tablets or nevirapine extended-release tablets after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Selected Clinical Adverse Drug Reactions* of at least Moderate Intensity (Grade 2 or above) Occurring in 2% or more of Adult Subjects- Week 96 Analysis of Trial 1100.14861 * Excludes laboratory abnormalities reported as ADRs 1 Mean observation period 98 weeks. 2 Rash includes terms rash, rash maculo-papular, erythema nodosum, rash erythematous, rash papular, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). 3 Clinical hepatitis includes terms hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis acute, liver disorder, hepatitis toxic, hepatic failure, jaundice.

Adverse reactions observed for nevirapine extended-release tablets subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) (nevirapine) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release nevirapine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine, prior to initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine extended-release tablets treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) ]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate-release nevirapine tablets twice daily who switch to nevirapine extended-release tablets therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release nevirapine tablets, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate-release nevirapine tablets in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine extended-release tablet for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Nevirapine extended-release tablet has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate-release nevirapine tablets daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate nevirapine extended-release tablets if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate-release nevirapine tablets lead-in period of 200 mg/day until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate-release nevirapine tablets lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate-release nevirapine tablets, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) (nevirapine) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine extended-release tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine extended-release tablets, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology(12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Fosamprenavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated. The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between immediate release Nevirapine Tablets and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -Adult patients: The most common adverse reaction is rash. During the lead-in period with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in adults is 3%. After the lead-in period the incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related rash in subjects taking Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets is 3%. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher drug-related clinical hepatitis after the lead-in phase was 2%. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alvogen at 1-866-770-3024 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. The safety database in Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets clinical trials contains data from 800 subjects treated with Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets and 654 subjects treated with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets. Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) In Trial 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-naive subjects received a lead-in dose of immediate release Nevirapine Tablets 200 mg once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomized to receive either immediate release Nevirapine Tablets 200 mg twice daily (n=506) or Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets 400 mg once daily (n=505). All subjects received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Subjects were enrolled with CD4+ counts less than 250 cells/mm3 for women and less than 400 cells/mm3 for men [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic events were prospectively collected in this trial. The safety data include all subject visits up to the time of the last subject's completion of the 96 week endpoint in the trial (mean observation period 98 weeks). After the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% in the immediate release Nevirapine Tablets group and 6% in the Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets group; the incidence of symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) was 3% and 2%, respectively. The incidence of GRADE 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% in both the immediate release Nevirapine Tablets group and Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of symptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE. Severe or life-threatening rash considered to be related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1% of subjects during the lead-in phase with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets, and in 1% of subjects in either treatment group during the randomization phase. In addition, six cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in the trial; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. No Grade 2 or above adverse reactions judged to be related to treatment by the investigator occurred in more than 2% of subjects during the 14-day lead-in with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets (200 mg once daily), with the exception of rash which occurred in 4% of subjects. Adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (Grades 2 or above) 2% or more of treatment-naive subjects receiving either immediate release Nevirapine Tablets or Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets after randomization in Trial 1100.1486 are shown in Table 2.

Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed in subjects receiving Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets. Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue therapy with nevirapine in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests.

Adverse reactions observed for Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets subjects (48 week analysis) were similar to those observed in trial 1100.1486, as displayed in Table 2. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) (nevirapine) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate release Nevirapine Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests prior to beginning the 14-day lead-in period with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets, prior to initiation of Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets (during the lead-in period), and at two weeks after initiation of Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets therapy. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Patients already on a regimen of immediate release Nevirapine Tablets twice daily who switch to Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets therapy should continue with their ongoing clinical and laboratory monitoring. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups in controlled clinical trials through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the patients with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of immediate release Nevirapine Tablets in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nevirapine. These have occurred most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients must initiate therapy with immediate release Nevirapine Tablets daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not initiate Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets if a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day immediate release Nevirapine Tablets lead-in period of 200 mg/day until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the immediate release Nevirapine Tablets lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial of immediate release Nevirapine Tablets, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Viramune XR(R) (nevirapine) extended-release tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing Nevirapine Extended Release Tablets, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction.

Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Antibiotics: Rifabutin | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increase. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combinations have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combinations have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of Nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-(800)-367-3395, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of Nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving Nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of Nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving Nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 1090Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3 Trials 1037, 1038, 1046Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue Nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing Nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 1090 1. Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037, 1038, 1046 2. Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of Nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to Nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and Nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of Nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with Nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of Nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with Nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout Nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with Nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the Nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue Nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue Nevirapine. Do not restart Nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of Nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with Nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of Nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue Nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart Nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected Nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue Nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with Nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue Nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase Nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping Nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with Nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of Nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of Nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent Nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing Nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than Nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and Nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including Nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of Nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of Nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine, Etravirine, Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be coadministered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be coadministered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone- maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin* |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin* | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine- associated adverse events. Ketoconazole* | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended.

An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1.

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (Table 2). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2). Table 2 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal vomiting Liver and Biliary jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic paraesthesia Skin and Appendages allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between Nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant drug Clinical Comment Atazanavir/Ritonavir | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure. Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Efavirenz | Efavirenz There has been no determination of appropriate doses for the safe and effective use of this combination [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended Fluconazole |Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine- associated adverse events. Fosamprenavir |Amprenavir |Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir |Amprenavir |Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. Indinavir | Indinavir Appropriate doses for this combination are not established, but an increase in the dosage of indinavir may be required. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Lopinavir/Ritonavir |Lopinavir A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500/125 mg twice-daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. In children 6 months to 12 years of age receiving lopinavir/ritonavir solution, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 13/3.25 mg/kg for those 7 to <15 kg; 11/2.75 mg/kg for those 15 to 45 kg; up to a maximum dose of 533/133 mg twice daily. Refer to the lopinavir/ritonavir package insert for complete pediatric dosing instructions when lopinavir/ritonavir tablets are used in combination with nevirapine. Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone- maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Nelfinavir |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate dose for nelfinavir in combination with nevirapine, with respect to safety and efficacy, has not been established. Rifabutin |Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between Nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Potential Drug Interactions Drug Class Examples of Drugs Antiarrhythmics Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antifungals Itraconazole Plasma concentrations of some azole antifungals may be decreased. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to a potential decrease in itraconazole plasma concentrations. Calcium channel blockers Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Cancer chemotherapy Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Ergot alkaloids Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Immunosuppressants Cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Motility agents Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Opiate agonists Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antithrombotics Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Co-administration of NEVIRAPINE can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% vs 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or www.amneal.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials in Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of Nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving Nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of Nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving Nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 <1 0 Headache 1 <1 4 1 Fatigue <1 <1 5 4 Diarrhea <1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain <1 <1 2 0 Myalgia <1 0 1 2 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving Nevirapine than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue Nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing Nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo Laboratory Abnormality (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Blood Chemistry SGPT (ALT) >250 U/L 5 4 14 4 SGOT (AST) >250 U/L 4 3 8 2 Bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL 2 2 2 2 Hematology Hemoglobin <8 g/dL 3 4 0 0 Platelets <50,000/mm3 1 1 <1 2 Neutrophils <750/mm3 13 14 4 1 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Nevirapine (n=305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with Nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of Nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to Nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and Nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of Nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with Nevirapine oral suspension, lamuvidine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%) and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of Nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions(5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with Nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with Nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout Nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with Nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactins occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received Nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the Nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue Nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue Nevirapine. Do not restart Nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3- fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of Nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with Nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with Nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting Nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of Nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reaction Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with Nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of Nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue Nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Do not restart Nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected Nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue Nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with Nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue Nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase Nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping Nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with Nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of Nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent Nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing Nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than Nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John\"s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John\"s wort-containing products and Nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including Nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of Nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of Nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4: Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/RitonavirThe interaction between nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700 mg/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir | Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500 mg/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533 mg/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated. The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be co-administered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Boceprevir Plasma concentrations of boceprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4/5 by nevirapine. Nevirapine and boceprevir should not be co-administered because decreases in boceprevir plasma concentrations may result in a reduction in efficacy. Telaprevir Plasma concentrations of telaprevir may be decreased due to induction of CYP3A4 by nevirapine and plasma concentrations of nevirapine may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Nevirapine and telaprevir should not be co-administered because changes in plasma concentrations of nevirapine, telaprevir, or both may result in a reduction in telaprevir efficacy or an increase in nevirapine-associated adverse events. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Itraconazole | Itraconazole Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)",
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects. (6.1) -In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21%. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4 + cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Trial 1090 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037, 1038, 1046 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n = 1121) (n = 1128) (n = 253) (n = 203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 < 1 0 Headache 1 < 1 4 1 Fatigue < 1 < 1 5 4 Diarrhea < 1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain < 1 < 1 2 0 Myalgia < 1 0 1 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3: Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 1090 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037, 1038, 1046 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n = 37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamuvidine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, four (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All four subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7)], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at 2 weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. -Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash:Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4 + cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4 + cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4 + cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4 + cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4 + cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4 + cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4 + cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4 + cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2 per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when coadministered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with coadministration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 5. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when coadministering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is coadministered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 4 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Atazanavir/Ritonavir | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not coadminister nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure. Clarithromycin | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Efavirenz | Efavirenz There has been no determination of appropriate doses for the safe and effective use of this combination [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Fluconazole | Nevirapine Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Fosamprenavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Coadministration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir | Amprenavir | Nevirapine No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is coadministered with 700 mg/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. Indinavir | Indinavir Appropriate doses for this combination are not established, but an increase in the dosage of indinavir may be required. Ketoconazole | Ketoconazole Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Lopinavir/Ritonavir | Lopinavir A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500 mg/125 mg twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533 mg/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. In children 6 months to 12 years of age receiving lopinavir/ritonavir solution, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 13/3.25 mg/kg for those 7 kg to < 15 kg; 11/2.75 mg/kg for those 15 kg to 45 kg; up to a maximum dose of 533 mg/133 mg twice daily. Refer to the lopinavir/ritonavir package insert for complete pediatric dosing instructions when lopinavir/ritonavir tablets are used in combination with nevirapine. Methadone | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Nelfinavir | Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite | Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate dose for nelfinavir in combination with nevirapine, with respect to safety and efficacy, has not been established. Rifabutin | Rifabutin Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Rifampin | Nevirapine Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Saquinavir/Ritonavir The interaction between nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Potential Drug Interactions: Drug Class Examples of Drugs Antiarrhythmics Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antifungals Itraconazole Plasma concentrations of some azole antifungals may be decreased. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to a potential decrease in itraconazole plasma concentrations. Calcium channel blockers Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Cancer chemotherapy Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Ergot alkaloids Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Immunosuppressants Cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Motility agents Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Opiate agonists Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Antithrombotics Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Coadministration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% vs. 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-4-INFO-RX (1-877-446-3679) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials in Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy or renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) ]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 3). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046 and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-related Events in Adult Placebo-controlled Trials Trial 1090Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037, 1038, 1046Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo (n = 1,121) (n = 1,128) (n = 253) (n = 203) Median exposure (weeks) 58 52 28 28 Any adverse event 15% 11% 32% 13% Rash 5 2 7 2 Nausea 1 1 9 4 Granulocytopenia 2 3 < 1 0 Headache 1 < 1 4 1 Fatigue < 1 < 1 5 4 Diarrhea < 1 1 2 1 Abdominal pain < 1 < 1 2 0 Myalgia < 1 0 1 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Liver enzyme test abnormalities (AST, ALT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (Table 3). Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 3). Table 3 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 1090Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Trials 1037, 1038, 1046Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV + ddI; nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n = 37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamuvidine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, four (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All four subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%) and hepatotoxicity (2%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorus Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue or significant hepatic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at 2 weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and nonfatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) Rash: Fatal and nonfatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life threatening and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%) and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 4 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Coadministration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in Clinical Pharmacology, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction trials conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction trials in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Table 3 Established and Potential Drug Interactions: Use With Caution, Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Needed Due to Drug Interaction Established Drug Interactions: See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 4 for Magnitude of Interaction. Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Nevirapine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents: Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Atazanavir/Ritonavir* | Atazanavir | Nevirapine Do not co-administer nevirapine with atazanavir because nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure and there is a potential risk for nevirapine-associated toxicity due to increased nevirapine exposures. Fosamprenavir* Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir* | Amprenavir | Nevirapine | Amprenavir | Nevirapine Co-administration of nevirapine and fosamprenavir without ritonavir is not recommended. No dosing adjustments are required when nevirapine is co-administered with 700/100 mg of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily. The combination of nevirapine administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily has not been studied. Indinavir* | Indinavir The appropriate doses of this combination of indinavir and nevirapine with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. Lopinavir/Ritonavir* |Lopinavir Dosing in adult patients: A dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir to 500/125 mg tablets twice daily or 533/133 mg (6.5 mL) oral solution twice daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Dosing in pediatric patients: Please refer to the Kaletra(R) prescribing information for dosing recommendations based on body surface area and body weight. Neither lopinavir/ritonavir tablets nor oral solution should be administered once daily in combination with nevirapine. Nelfinavir* |Nelfinavir M8 Metabolite |Nelfinavir Cmin The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir/ritonavir The interaction between Nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated The appropriate doses of the combination of nevirapine and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. HIV Antiviral Agents: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Efavirenz* Delavirdine Etravirine Rilpivirine | Efavirenz The appropriate doses of these combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Plasma concentrations may be altered. Nevirapine should not be coadministered with another NNRTI as this combination has not been shown to be beneficial. Other Agents Analgesics: Methadone* | Methadone Methadone levels were decreased; increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, disopyramide, lidocaine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Antibiotics: Clarithromycin* Rifabutin* Rifampin* | Clarithromycin | 14-OH clarithromycin | Rifabutin | Nevirapine Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased. Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants. Antifungals: Fluconazole* Ketoconazole* Itraconazole |Nevirapine | Ketoconazole | Itraconazole Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug. Antithrombotics: Warfarin Plasma concentrations may be increased. Potential effect on anticoagulation. Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Cancer chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Ergot alkaloids: Ergotamine Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for these combinations have not been established. Motility agents: Cisapride Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Opiate agonists: Fentanyl Plasma concentrations may be decreased. Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol and Norethindrone* | Ethinyl estradiol | Norethindrone Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. * The interaction between Nevirapine and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug interactions shown are predicted. Co-administration of nevirapine can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (5.4, 7, 12.3)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse reaction is rash. In adults the incidence of rash is 15% versus 6% with placebo, with Grade 3/4 rash occurring in 2% of subjects (6.1) -In pediatric subjects the incidence of rash (all causality) was 21% (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (855) 724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2 )]. Hepatic Reaction In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts (greater than 250 cells/mm3 in women and greater than 400 cells/mm3 in men) place patients at increased risk of these events [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5X ULN) were observed in 6% (range 0% to 9%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 6% of subjects in control groups. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT, GGT) were observed more frequently in subjects receiving nevirapine than in controls (see Table 2). Skin Reaction The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, which can be severe or life-threatening [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Rash occurs most frequently within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. In controlled clinical trials (Trials 1037, 1038, 1046, and 1090), Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of subjects receiving nevirapine compared to 6% receiving placebo during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo. Women tend to be at higher risk for development of nevirapine-associated rash [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Treatment-related, adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity observed in greater than 2% of subjects receiving nevirapine in placebo-controlled trials are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Percentage of Subjects with Moderate or Severe Drug-Related Events in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs. Subjects had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3. 2 Background therapy included ZDV and ZDV+ddI; Nevirapine monotherapy was administered in some subjects. Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3.

Asymptomatic elevations in GGT occur frequently but are not a contraindication to continue nevirapine therapy in the absence of elevations in other liver enzyme tests. Other laboratory abnormalities (bilirubin, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were observed with similar frequencies in clinical trials comparing nevirapine and control regimens (see Table 2). Table 2 Percentage of Adult Subjects with Laboratory Abnormalities Trial 10901 Trials 1037, 1038, 10462 Nevirapine Placebo Nevirapine Placebo Laboratory Abnormality (n=1121) (n=1128) (n=253) (n=203) Blood Chemistry SGPT (ALT) >250 U/L 5 4 14 4 SGOT (AST) >250 U/L 4 3 8 2 Bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL 2 2 2 2 Hematology Hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL 3 4 0 0 Platelets <50,000/mm3 1 1 <1 2 Neutrophils <750/mm3 13 14 4 1 1 Background therapy included 3TC for all subjects and combinations of NRTIs and PIs.

Subjects had CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. 6.2 Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nevirapine (n=305) in which pediatric subjects received combination treatment with nevirapine. In this trial two subjects were reported to experience Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome. Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of nevirapine (n=37) in which subjects were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these subjects in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of granulocytopenia, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and nevirapine. Cases of allergic reaction, including one case of anaphylaxis, were also reported. The safety of nevirapine was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical trial performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with nevirapine oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rash (all causality) was reported in 21% of the subjects, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to rash. All 4 subjects experienced the rash early in the course of therapy (less than 4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), and hepatotoxicity (2%) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety information on use of nevirapine in combination therapy in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 3 months of age was assessed in 36 subjects from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) trial. No unexpected safety findings were observed although granulocytopenia was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events identified during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of nevirapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: fever, somnolence, drug withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Gastrointestinal: vomiting Liver and Biliary: jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure Hematology: anemia, eosinophilia, neutropenia Investigations: decreased serum phosphorous Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis associated with skin and/or liver reactions Neurologic: paraesthesia Skin and Appendages: allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous eruptions, ulcerative stomatitis and urticaria have all been reported. In addition, hypersensitivity syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions with rash associated with constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, fatigue, or significant hepatic abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] plus one or more of the following: hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and/or renal dysfunction have been reported. In post-marketing surveillance anemia has been more commonly observed in children although development of anemia due to concomitant medication use cannot be ruled out."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The most serious adverse reactions associated with nevirapine are hepatitis/hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events and skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . -Hepatotoxicity:Fatal and non-fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Monitor liver function tests before and during therapy. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. (5.1) -Rash: Fatal and non-fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue nevirapine if severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Check transaminase immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. (5.2) -Monitor patients for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution (5.5 , 5.6). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups. The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests. Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [ see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment. The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+ cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4+ cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+ cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3 (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3 (6% versus 1% for men with CD4+ cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+ cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT. In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction. If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue nevirapine in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue nevirapine if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase nevirapine dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m2/day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved. The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping nevirapine treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine. In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended. 5.3 Resistance Nevirapine must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ see Microbiology (12.4)]. 5.4 Drug Interactions See Table 3 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John's wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs. Co-administration of nevirapine and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillian-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."
