        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS If co-administered with cimetidine: Maximum single dose of 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period. (2.3, 7.4) 7.1 Ergot-containing drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and ZOMIG within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of ZOMIG in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans) Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of ZOMIG treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of ZOMIG and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and ZOMIG are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of ZOMIG to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and triptans [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of labeling: -Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] -Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] -Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] -Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] -Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] -Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] -Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] -Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and > placebo) were: -Adults: unusual taste, paresthesia, dizziness, and hyperesthesia (6.1) -Pediatrics: unusual taste (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Impax Laboratories at 1-877-994-6729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with ZOMIG nasal spray in a blinded placebo-controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of ZOMIG nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for ZOMIG nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose-related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in >=2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) ZOMIG 2.5 mg (N=224) ZOMIG 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in >=1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either ZOMIG nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using ZOMIG 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of ZOMIG nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of >= 2% of patients in any ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with ZOMIG nasal spray is similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray (see ZOMIG tablet/ZOMIG-ZMT oral disintegrating tablet Prescribing Information). Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of ZOMIG nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of >=2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving ZOMIG compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in >= 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg ZOMIG dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) ZOMIG 2.5 mg (N=81) ZOMIG 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ZOMIG. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ZOMIG."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) -Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) -Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) -Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) -Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) -Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) -Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7, 7.5) -Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events (5.8) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of ZOMIG. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including ZOMIG may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZOMIG. Do not administer ZOMIG if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first ZOMIG dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZOMIG administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue ZOMIG if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive ZOMIG [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with ZOMIG and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue ZOMIG if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. ZOMIG should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional ZOMIG doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. ZOMIG treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in ZOMIG-treated patients. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]."

Serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of ZOMIG Tablets. These reactions are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Reactions reported, in association with triptans, have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Among 464 adult patients treating single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial, there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious reaction. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that was incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of ZOMIG Nasal Spray. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials for ZOMIG Nasal Spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness.

Local Adverse Reactions: Among 922 patients using the zolmitriptan nasal spray to treat 2311 attacks in the controlled clinical study who were exposed, across all doses (0.5 to 5 mg), approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 60% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of ZOMIG Nasal Spray.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following section enumerates potentially important adverse reactions that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The reactions enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and non-domestic use of oral zolmitriptan. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite reactions reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of reactions and the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Cardiovascular: Coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Digestive: Very rare gastrointestinal ischemic reactions including splenic infarction, ischemic colitis and gastrointestinal infarction or necrosis have been reported; these may present as bloody diarrhea or abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. General: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been very rare reports of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions in patients receiving ZOMIG. There have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported during the postmarketing period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Neurological: As with other acute migraine treatments including other 5HT1 agonists, there have been rare reports of headache."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, and life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm (5.1) It is strongly recommended that ZOMIG not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors. In very rare cases, serious cardiovascular events have been reported in association with ZOMIG in the absence of known cardiovascular disease. If ZOMIG is considered, patients should first have a cardiovascular evaluation. If the evaluation is satisfactory, first dose should take place in a physician's office setting (5.1) Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure and heaviness in the chest, throat, neck and jaw: generally not associated with myocardial ischemia, but patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of angina should be evaluated for the presence of CAD (5.2) Cerebrovascular events, some fatal (5.3) Gastrointestinal ischemic events and peripheral vasospastic reactions (e.g. Raynaud's syndrome) (5.4) Patients with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathways should not receive ZOMIG (5.1) Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome, particularly in combination with SSRIs or SNRIs. Monitor patients carefully if concomitant treatment is clinically warranted (5.5, 7.6) Increase in blood pressure, very rarely associated with significant clinical events (4.4, 5.6) 5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT1 Agonists Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other 5-HT1 agonists. Considering the extent of use of 5-HT1 agonists in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. ZOMIG can cause coronary artery vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac disease history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to ZOMIG use, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. In the cases where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Patients with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive ZOMIG. Premarketing experience with zolmitriptan Among the more than 2,500 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of ZOMIG Tablets, no deaths or serious cardiac events were reported. In a premarketing controlled clinical trial of ZOMIG Nasal Spray, more than 1,300 patients participated and there were no deaths or serious cardiac events to report. Postmarketing experience with zolmitriptan Serious cardiovascular events have been reported in association with the use of ZOMIG Tablets, and in very rare cases, these events have occurred in the absence of known cardiovascular disease. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by zolmitriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. Patients with documented coronary artery disease Because of the potential of this class of compound (5-HT1 agonists) to cause coronary vasospasm, ZOMIG should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Patients with risk factors for CAD It is strongly recommended that zolmitriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history, electrocardiographic or other investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, zolmitriptan should not be administered [see Contraindications (4.1)]. For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of zolmitriptan take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received zolmitriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following ZOMIG, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use ZOMIG. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to zolmitriptan. 5.2 Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure in the chest and or throat, neck and jaw As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw have been reported after treatment with ZOMIG Tablets. Because 5-HT1 agonists may cause coronary vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms occur. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists [see Contraindications (4.1)]. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (eg, stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack) [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.4 Other Vasospasm-Related Events, including Peripheral Vascular Ischemia and Colonic Ischemia 5-HT1 agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm, such as peripheral and gastrointestinal vascular ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow following the use of any 5-HT agonist, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome, are candidates for further evaluation [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 5.5 Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG treatment, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with ZOMIG and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [See Drug Interactions (7.5)]. 5.6 Increase in Blood Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported on rare occasions with ZOMIG Tablet use, in patients with and without a history of hypertension; very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In volunteers, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen at 5 mg. In the headache trials, vital signs were measured only in the small inpatient study and no effect on blood pressure was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver disease, 7 of 27 experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan [see Contraindications (4.4)]. An 18% increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure was seen following dosing with another 5-HT1 agonist in a study evaluating subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization. 5.7 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues When pigmented rats were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of radiolabeled zolmitriptan, the radioactivity in the eye after 7 days, the latest time point examined, was still 75% of the value measured after 4 hours. This suggests that zolmitriptan and/or its metabolites may bind to the melanin of the eye. Because there could be accumulation in melanin rich tissues over time, this raises the possibility that zolmitriptan could cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. However, no effects on the retina related to treatment with zolmitriptan were noted in any of the toxicity studies including those conducted by the nasal route. Although no systematic monitoring of ophthalmologic function was undertaken in clinical trials, and no specific recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring are offered, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.8 Laboratory Tests No monitoring of specific laboratory tests is recommended. 5.9 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Zolmitriptan is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests."
