"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperglycemia may occur due to systemic absorption. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. (5.1, 8.4) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of high potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure and young age. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate lotion on the HPA axis, 15 mL were applied without occlusion twice daily (30 mL per day) for 7 days to 4 adult subjects with scalp and body psoriasis. At the end of treatment, the plasma cortisol levels for each of the 4 subjects remained within the normal range and changed little from baseline. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, ELOCON Lotion should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of ELOCON Lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."$$

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In clinical trials involving 209 subjects, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of ELOCON Lotion was 3%. Reported reactions included acneiform reaction, 2; burning, 4; and itching, 1. In an irritation/sensitization study involving 156 normal subjects, the incidence of folliculitis was 3% (4 subjects). The following adverse reactions were reported to be possibly or probably related to treatment with ELOCON Lotion during a clinical trial in 14% of 65 pediatric subjects 6 months to 2 years of age: decreased glucocorticoid levels, 4; paresthesia, 2; dry mouth,1; an unspecified endocrine disorder, 1; pruritus, 1; and an unspecified skin disorder, 1.
