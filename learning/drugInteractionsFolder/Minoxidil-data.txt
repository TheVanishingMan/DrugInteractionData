"ADVERSE REACTIONS 1. Salt and Water Retention (see WARNINGS: Concomitant use of Adequate Diuretic is Required) \\342\\200\\224 Temporary edema developed in 7% of patients who were not edematous at the start of therapy. 2. Pericarditis, Pericardial Effusion and Tamponade (see WARNINGS ). 3. Dermatologic \\342\\200\\224 Hypertrichosis \\342\\200\\224 Elongation, thickening, and enhanced pigmentation of fine body hair are seen in about 80% of patients taking minoxidil tablets. This develops within 3 to 6 weeks after starting therapy. It is usually first noticed on the temples, between the eyebrows, between the hairline and the eyebrows, or in the side-burn area of the upper lateral cheek, later extending to the back, arms, legs, and scalp. Upon discontinuation of minoxidil, new hair growth stops, but 1 to 6 months may be required for restoration to pretreatment appearance. No endocrine abnormalities have been found to explain the abnormal hair growth; thus, it is hypertrichosis without virilism. Hair growth is especially disturbing to children and women and such patients should be thoroughly informed about this effect before therapy with minoxidil is begun. Allergic \\342\\200\\224 Rashes have been reported, including rare reports of bullous eruptions, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 4. Hematologic \\342\\200\\224 Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (WBC<3000/mm3) have rarely been reported. 5. Gastrointestinal \\342\\200\\224 Nausea and/or vomiting has been reported. In clinical trials the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the underlying disease has shown a decrease from pretrial levels. 6. Miscellaneous \\342\\200\\224 Breast tenderness \\342\\200\\224 This developed in less than 1 % of patients. 7. Altered Laboratory Findings \\342\\200\\224 (a) ECG changes \\342\\200\\224 Changes in direction and magnitude of the ECG T-waves occur in approximately 60% of patients treated with minoxidil. In rare instances a large negative amplitude of the T-wave may encroach upon the S-T segment, but the S-T segment is not independently altered. These changes usually disappear with continuance of treatment and revert to the pretreatment state if minoxidil is discontinued. No symptoms have been associated with these changes, nor have there been alterations in blood cell counts or in plasma enzyme concentrations that would suggest myocardial damage. Long-term treatment of patients manifesting such changes has provided no evidence of deteriorating cardiac function. At present the changes appear to be nonspecific and without identifiable clinical significance. (b) Effects of hemodilution \\342\\200\\224 hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocyte count usually fall about 7% initially and then recover to pretreatment levels. (c) Other \\342\\200\\224 Alkaline phosphatase increased varyingly without other evidence of liver or bone abnormality. Serum creatinine increased an average of 6% and BUN slightly more, but later declined to pretreatment levels."$$
