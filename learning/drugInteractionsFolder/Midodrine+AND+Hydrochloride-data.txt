"Drug Interactions When administered concomitantly with midodrine, cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, A.V. block or arrhythmia. The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of midodrine. Therefore, caution should be used when midodrine is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction. Midodrine has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation. The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with midodrine.
