"Drug Interactions Beta adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta adrenergic agonists on the vascular system may be potentiated."$$
"Drug Interactions: Other beta adrenergic bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with metaproterenol because they may have additive effects. Beta adrenergic agonist should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta adrenergic agonists on the vascular system may be potentiated."$$
