        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole sodium and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole sodium causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole sodium may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. See Drug Interactions (7.5). Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: PROTONIX may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including PROTONIX, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX and MMF. Use PROTONIX with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. ( 5.4 ) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions). Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin (see below), midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts)."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of pantoprazole sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel­-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX and MMF. Use PROTONIX with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.4 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.6 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.4)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy ( 5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy ( 5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. ( 5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. ( 5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1) ]. 5.9 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6) ]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not coadminister with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

        "Warnings and Precautions Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets and MMF. Use Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.

Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients With GERD at a Frequency of > 2% Pantoprazole Comparators Placebo (n = 1473) (n = 345) (n = 82) % % % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7.0 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting 4.3 3.5 2.4 Flatulence 3.9 2.9 3.7 Dizziness 3.0 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) -Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

However, due to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole sodium and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of pantoprazole sodium.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant use of pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir. (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring. (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil). (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC. (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may increase serum level of methotrexate. (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.11 Concomitant use of PROTONIX with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets and MMF. Use Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]."

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral Pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to Pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for Pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking Pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs (5.3) -Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin (5.4) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.5) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine (5.6) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with Pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy.

For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of Pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy ( 5.1 )-Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy ( 5.2 )-Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. ( 5.3 )-Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.4 )-PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. ( 5.5 )-Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.6 )-Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.7 ) Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. See Drug Interactions (7.5). Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX I.V. and MMF. Use PROTONIX I.V. with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors including pantoprazole.

These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency PROTONIX contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX I.V. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy.

Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole sodium causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole sodium may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.4 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results."

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.5 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions). Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin (see below), midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy. (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS {template} Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.5) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [See Adverse Reactions 6.2 )] 5.6 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 5.7 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: PROTONIX may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX. 7.4 Drugs for which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX I.V. and MMF. Use PROTONIX I.V. with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors including pantoprazole. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, approximately 80,500 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: -For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 1. The number of patients treated in comparative studies with I.V. pantoprazole is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with I.V. pantoprazole.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole (5.2) -Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole (5.3) -Zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously (5.4) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.5) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.6) -Bone Fracture: PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine after long term and multiple daily dose. (5.7) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.9) 5.1 Implications of Symptomatic Response Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole. These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency PROTONIX contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX I.V. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.7 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.11 Concomitant use of PROTONIX with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

Therefore, pantoprazole sodium may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: PROTONIX may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX. 7.4 Drugs for which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX I.V. and MMF. Use PROTONIX I.V. with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors including pantoprazole. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole (5.2) Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole (5.3) Zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously (5.4) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.5) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.6) Bone Fracture: PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine after long term and multiple daily dose. (5.7) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.9) 5.1 Implications of Symptomatic Response Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole. These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency PROTONIX contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX I.V. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy.

In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) Co-administration of clopidogrel with 80mg pantoprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel (7.3). May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended.Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrelinduced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.

This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least 3 months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: PROTONIX may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX. 7.4 Drugs for which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX I.V. and MMF. Use PROTONIX I.V. with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors including pantoprazole. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, approximately 80,500 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 1. The number of patients treated in comparative studies with I.V. pantoprazole is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with I.V. pantoprazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Investigations: weight changes Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and angioedema (Quincke's edema) Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Psychiatric Disorder: hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole (5.2) Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole (5.3) Zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously (5.4) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.5) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.6) Bone Fracture: PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine after long term and multiple daily dose. ( 5.7) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.9) 5.1 Implications of Symptomatic Response Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole. These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency PROTONIX contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX I.V. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.7 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown. [see Adverse Reactions(6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.11 Concomitant use of PROTONIX with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with PROTONIX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with PROTONIX, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of PROTONIX. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown (see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1). 5.6 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ). 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir. (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring. (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil). (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC. (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may increase serum level of methotrexate. (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

(5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.

Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H 2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy ( 5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy ( 5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. ( 5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. ( 5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [ see Contraindications ( 4) ]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) ]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1) ]. 5.9 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6) ]."

Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole sodium causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole sodium may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.4 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [See Adverse Reactions 6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]."

No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Coadministration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole and MMF. Use pantoprazole with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.

For safety information in patients less than one year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy. (5.2) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) -Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least 3 months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy. (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole sodium and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not coadminister with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference With Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Coadministration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole and MMF. Use pantoprazole with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) -Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole.

Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "Drug Interactions Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions ). Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin (see below), midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, more than 11,100 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment. In general, pantoprazole has been well tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. In two U.S. controlled clinical trials involving pantoprazole sodium 10, 20, or 40 mg doses for up to 8 weeks, there were no dose-related effects on the incidence of adverse events. The following adverse events considered by investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to drug occurred in 1% or more in the individual studies of GERD patients on therapy with pantoprazole sodium.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) - Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) - Bone Fracture: - Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) - Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.5) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [ See Adverse Reactions 6.2) ] 5.6 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.7 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5)."

Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrelinduced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium delayed-release may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions 6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions ). Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin (see below), midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, more than 11,100 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment. In general, pantoprazole has been well tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. In two U.S. controlled clinical trials involving pantoprazole sodium 10, 20, or 40 mg doses for up to 8 weeks, there were no dose-related effects on the incidence of adverse events. The following adverse events considered by investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to drug occurred in 1% or more in the individual studies of GERD patients on therapy with pantoprazole sodium.

However, due to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole sodium was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium for injection and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium for injection with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors including pantoprazole. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, approximately 80,500 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AuroMedics Pharma LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 1. The number of patients treated in comparative studies with I.V. pantoprazole is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with I.V. pantoprazole.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole (5.2) Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole (5.3) Zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously (5.4) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.5) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.6) Bone Fracture: PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine after long term and multiple daily doses. (5.7) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.9) 5.1 Implications of Symptomatic Response Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole. These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency Pantoprazole sodium for injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium for injection. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for injection if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.7 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.11 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk ofClostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [See Adverse Reactions 6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Clostridium Difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: -For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) -For pediatric use (>4%) are URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral Pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients with GERD at a Frequency of > 2% Pantoprazole (n=1473) % Comparators (n=345) % Placebo (n=82) % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7.0 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting 4.3 3.5 2.4 Flatulence 3.9 2.9 3.7 Dizziness 3.0 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for Pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elecated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of Pantoprazole in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to Pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for Pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking Pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with Pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of Pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium and MMF.

        "Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse reaction profiles for pantoprazole sodium delayed-release oral suspension and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are similar. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) For pediatric use (>4%) are URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium delayed-release (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium delayed-release may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions 6.2) ]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevausa.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

However, due to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.6 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.4)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not coadminister with atazanavir or nelfinavir. (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring. (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability. (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC. (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been post-marketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy. (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least 3 months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (5.4) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine (5.5) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with Pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of Pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets and MMF. Use Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed- Release Tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to Pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.

Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients With GERD at a Frequency of > 2% Pantoprazole Comparators Placebo (n = 1473) (n = 345) (n = 82) % % % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7.0 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting 4.3 3.5 2.4 Flatulence 3.9 2.9 3.7 Dizziness 3.0 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) -Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference With Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.10 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole With Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions). Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin (see below), midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts)."

SKIN AND APPENDAGES: severe dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal). SPECIAL SENSES: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, blurred vision, tinnitus. UROGENITAL SYSTEM: interstitial nephritis. Laboratory Values In two U.S. controlled, short-term trials in patients with erosive esophagitis associated with GERD, 0.4% of the patients on pantoprazole sodium 40 mg experienced SGPT elevations of greater than three times the upper limit of normal at the final treatment visit. In two U.S. controlled, long-term trials in patients with erosive esophagitis associated with GERD, none of 178 patients (0%) on pantoprazole sodium 40 mg and two of 181 patients (1.1%) on pantoprazole sodium 20 mg experienced significant transaminase elevations at 12 months (or earlier if a patient discontinued prematurely). Significant elevations of SGOT or SGPT were defined as values at least three times the upper limit of normal that were non-sporadic and had no clear alternative explanation. The following changes in laboratory parameters were reported as adverse events: creatinine increased, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperuricemia."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel­-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of Methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients with GERD at a Frequency of > 2% Pantoprazole (n=1473) % Comparators (n=345) % Placebo (n=82) % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7.0 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting 4.3 3.5 2.4 Flatulence 3.9 2.9 3.7 Dizziness 3.0 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia,myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not coadminister with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Coadministration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole and MMF. Use pantoprazole with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) For pediatric use (>4%) are URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole:allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (5.4) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

(5.4) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.5) Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Hypomagnesemia , symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [ See Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. See Drug Interactions (7.5). Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]"

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium is considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium.

Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.

Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of Pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [See Adverse Reactions 6.2 )] 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5). 5.9 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]"

However, due to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been post-marketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages one year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than one year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. (5.1) -Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy. (5.2) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.4) -Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.5) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.6) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least 3 months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.8 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.5) . 5.9 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) -Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) -May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.4) -May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) -Methotrexate: Pantoprazole may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including Pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of Pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets and MMF. Use Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to PROTONIX are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for PROTONIX in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking PROTONIX 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of PROTONIX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hypomagnesemia Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with PROTONIX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with PROTONIX, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of PROTONIX. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown (see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1). 5.6 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ). 5.7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [See Adverse Reactions 6.2)]"

However, due to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.4) Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.5) Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [See Adverse Reactions 6.2)] Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. See Drug Interactions (7.5)."

Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrelinduced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) - Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) - May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil)(7.4) - May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) - Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel - induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) Bone Fracture Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5) 5.1 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Atrophic Gastritis Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. 5.3 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.6 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions (7.4).",

(7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may increase serum level of methotrexate. (7.6) Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) -Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole (5.2) -Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole (5.3) -Zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously (5.4) -Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.5) -PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.6) -Bone Fracture: PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine after long term and multiple daily dose. (5.7) -Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.9) 5.1 Implications of Symptomatic Response Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of intravenous pantoprazole. These may require emergency medical treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.3 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole. 5.4 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency PROTONIX contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. for Injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. 5.5 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX I.V. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.7 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered intravenous pantoprazole is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.11 Concomitant use of PROTONIX with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir ( 7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring ( 7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) ( 7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC ( 7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate ( 7.6) 7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. 7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 7.3 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 7.6 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5 .10)]."

Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis . Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications ( 4)] . 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.5 Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)].

In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1)]. 5.9 Interference with Urine Screen for THC See Drug Interactions ( 7.5) 5.10 Concomitant use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1) Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2) May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib and mycophenolate mofetil) (7.4) May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.5) Methotrexate: Pantoprazole sodium may increase serum level of methotrexate (7.6) Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole sodium, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium. Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease. Co-administration of pantoprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are as follows: For adult use (>2%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. (6) For pediatric use (>4%) are URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients with GERD at a Frequency of > 2% Pantoprazole sodium (n=1473) % Comparators (n=345) % Placebo (n=82) % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting Flatulence 4.3 3.9 3.5 2.9 2.4 3.7 Dizziness 3 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of pantoprazole sodium in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium is considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of <= 4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome In clinical studies of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock) Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal), and angioedema (Quincke's edema)"

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy (5.1) - Atrophic gastritis has been noted with long-term therapy (5.2) - Acute gastritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (5.3) - Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin.(5.4) - PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. (5.5) - Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. (5.6) - Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (5.7) Symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with pantoprazole sodium, particularly in patients who were H. pylori positive. Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. See Drug Interactions (7.5) Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]."

No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole. 7.4 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). 7.5 False Positive Urine Tests for THC There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors.
