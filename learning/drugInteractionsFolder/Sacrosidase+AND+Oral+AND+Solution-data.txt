          "SACROSIDASE"
        "brand_name": [
          "Sucraid"
 
      "drug_interactions": [
        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Neither drug-drug nor drug-food interactions are expected or have been reported with the use of Sucraid. However, Sucraid should not be reconstituted or consumed with fruit juice, since its acidity may reduce the enzyme activity."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse experiences with Sucraid in clinical trials were generally minor and were frequently associated with the underlying disease. In clinical studies of up to 54 months duration, physicians treated a total of 52 patients with Sucraid. The adverse experiences and respective number of patients reporting each event (in parenthesis) were as follows: abdominal pain (4), vomiting (3), nausea (2), diarrhea (2), constipation (2), insomnia (1) headache (1) nervousness (1) and dehydration (1). Note: diarrhea and abdominal pain can be a part of the clinical presentation of the genetically determined sucrase deficiency, which is part of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). One asthmatic child experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction (wheezing) probably related to sacrosidase (see Warnings). The event resulted in withdrawal of the patient from the trial but resolved with no sequelae."
