        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of Ondansetron Oral Solution, USP. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n=300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n=124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n=117 Headache 33(11%) 16(13%) 17(15%) Diarrhea 13(4%) 9(7%) 3(3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n=242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n=415 Placebo n=262 Headache 58(24%) 113(27%) 34(13%) Malaise/fatigue 32(13%) 37(9%) 6(2%) Constipation 22(9%) 26(6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15(6%) 16(4%) 10(4%) Dizziness 13(5%) 18(4%) 12(5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7: Frequency of Adverse Events From Controlled Studies With Ondansetron Tablets (Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting) Adverse Event Ondansetron 16 mg (n = 550) Placebo (n = 531) Wound problem 152(28%) 162(31%) Drowsiness/sedation 112(20%) 122(23%) Headache 49(9%) 27(5%) Hypoxia 49(9%) 35(7%) Pyrexia 45(8%) 34(6%) Dizziness 36(7%) 34(6%) Gynecological disorder 36(7%) 33(6%) Anxiety/agitation 33(6%) 29(5%) Bradycardia 32(6%) 30(6%) Shiver(s) 28(5%) 30(6%) Urinary retention 28(5%) 18(3%) Hypotension 27(5%) 32(6%) Pruritus 27(5%) 20(4%) Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS ∙ Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.6 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.7 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylatic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ∙ Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) ∙ QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) ∙ Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.3) (5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.4 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1, 3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4, 5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron.

(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2 ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has not been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Overdosage (10) , Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15 mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular : Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General : Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary : Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions : Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory : Hiccups Neurological : Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders : Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m 2). Table 5.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined.

Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. ( 7.2 ) Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection, USP (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylatic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported.

Hepatic:In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary:Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reactions (>= 7%) in adults are diarrhea, headache, and fever. (6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1) The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin : In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic druginteraction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4.5 Chemotherapy : Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic : In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary : Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other : Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular:Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal:Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic:In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary:Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological:There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular:Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General:Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary:Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions:Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory:Hiccups Neurological:Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin:Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders:Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1 ,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS ). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4 ,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d . (n=300) Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d .

(n=117) Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d . (n=242) Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d .

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurology Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see ). In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs. Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol. Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.

In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron tablets, USP were unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron tablets, USP. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Liver enzyme abnormalities Hiccups Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Urticaria Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection, USP across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection, USP was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Adverse Reaction Ondansetron Injection, USP 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse Reaction Adverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups,Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection, USP 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection, USP (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4, 5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection, USP is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see : ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs. 1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see ). 3 WARNINGS Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol. 4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets have been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5.

The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. ( 7.2 ) Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylatic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Hiccups Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Urticaria Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. ( 5.1 ) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ( 5.2 ) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. ( 5.3 ) ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron . Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia ), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias , or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. The use of Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. Ondansetron Injection, USP is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. ( 7.2) Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications ( 4)] . In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection, USP (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] . General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylatic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs.(5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron . Avoid Ondansetron Injection USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia ), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias , or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection USP alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron Injection USP in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection USP is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONSThe following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose 50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic:In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary:Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other:Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in 5% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice:In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron hydrochloride. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron hydrochloride. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distention The use of Ondansetron Injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride tablets, ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets and ondansetron hydrochloride oral solution. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24-mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d . n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d . n=124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d . n=117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >= 5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d . n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d . n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron.

(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >=2% (and With Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes a Adverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups b Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Adverse Reactiona,b Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (<1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (<1%) Pediatric Use Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2 ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has not been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reactions (>= 7%) in adults are diarrhea, headache, and fever. (6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1 ) The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection, USP across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection, USP (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Number of Adult Patients With Reaction Adverse Reaction Ondansetron Injection, USP 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and With Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection, USP 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (<1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (<1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection, USP (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylatic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor agonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.3)(5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection, USP is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg Ondansetron Tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m ). Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: 2 Table 5.

Central Nervous System: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving Ondansetron Tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. Hepatic: There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Integumentary: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Other: The adverse events reported in patients receiving Ondansetron Tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving Ondansetron Tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving Ondansetron Tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: Table 7.

In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Observed During Clinical Practice: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. Cardiovascular: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets have been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron hydrochloride. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy with 24 mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >= 5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets two or three times a day for 3 days or placebo in four trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology : Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders : Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see ). In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs. Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol. Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover studying 76 patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.",

(6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1) The most common adverse reaction (>= 2 %) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Adverse Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distention The use of Ondansetron Injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. ( 7.2 ) Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in >5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients With Reaction Ondansetron Injection, USP 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. ( 5.1 ) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ( 5.2 ) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.3 )-Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. ( 5.4 )( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2 ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has not been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Section Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "Warnings And Precautions Section Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.3)(5.4) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from two small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. Cardiovascular: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1.

Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2 ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has not been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5) , Overdosage (10) , Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - -The most common adverse reactions (>= 7%) in adults are diarrhea, headache, and fever. (6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - -The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1) -The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes a Adverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups b Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Adverse Reactiona,b Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron hydrochloride. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy with 24 mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >= 5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets two or three times a day for 3 days or placebo in four trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6: Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self-administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1, 3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4, 5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets have been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >= 5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron tablets were unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron tablets. Cardiovascular Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4 )]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection, USP across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection, USP was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients With Reaction Ondansetron Injection, USP 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection, USP (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron Injection, USP in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection, USP is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Transient dizziness during or shortly after I.V. infusion. Eye Disorders: Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation. Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1.

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distention The use of Ondansetron Injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from two small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. ( 7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contradindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.",

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in >5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients With Reaction Ondansetron Injection, USP 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, USP, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. ( 5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ( 5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. ( 5.4)( 5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [ see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2 ]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection, USP alone has not been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection, USP and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection, USP and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection, USP is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron hydrochloride. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary : Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

(6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - -The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1) -The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron hydrochloride across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15 mg/kg Doses Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Adverse Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups,Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1 mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron hydrochloride (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory Hiccups Neurological Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron hydrochloride in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron hydrochloride in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron hydrochloride alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome concomitant use of ondansetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see ). In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs. Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol. Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover studying 76 patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron tablets, USP were unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets, USP at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials.

(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased.

Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron hydrochloride across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1.

Gastrointestinal Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron hydrochloride (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron hydrochloride in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron hydrochloride in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron hydrochloride alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome concomitant use of ondansetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small trials indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these trials, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient-controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and brochospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ZUPLENZ in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECG in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. (5.2) The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. (5.3) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. ZUPLENZ (ondansetron) oral soluble film should be discontinued immediately at the first sign of hypersensitivity. 5.2 Electrocardiographic Changes ECG changes including QT interval prolongation has been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ZUPLENZ in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Masking of Progressive Ileus and/or Gastric Distension The use of ZUPLENZ in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. 5.4 Effect on Peristalsis ZUPLENZ is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron hydrochloride tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron hydrochloride tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur.

Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] . 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotinin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reactions (>= 7%) in adults are diarrhea, headache, and fever. (6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache. (6.1) The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Vigilance & Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15 mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting : The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse Reaction a,b Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) a Adverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups b Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1 mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups. Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsades de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4, 5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol. 4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m ). Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: 2 Table 5.

These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Central Nervous System: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. Hepatic: There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Integumentary: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Other: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation and diarrhea. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: Table 7.

In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron.

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) ZUPLENZ in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECG in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. (5.2) The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. ZUPLENZ (ondansetron) oral soluble film should be discontinued immediately at the first sign of hypersensitivity. 5.2 Electrocardiographic Changes ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ZUPLENZ in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Zuplenz and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Zuplenz and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Zuplenz is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Overdosage (10.), Patient Counseling Information (17.)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and/or Gastric Distension The use of ZUPLENZ in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis ZUPLENZ is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous Ondansetron Injection across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Injection (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Adverse Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular: Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic: In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving Ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other: Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron Injection (2%) compared to placebo (< 1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron Injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of Ondansetron Injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distention The use of Ondansetron Injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron Injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.",

        "Drug Interactions Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Apomorphine: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS). Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5 Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients: The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System: There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic: In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary: Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other: Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7. Frequency of Adverse Events From Controlled Studies With Ondansetron Tablets (Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting) Adverse Event Ondansetron 16 mg (n = 550) Placebo (n = 531) Wound problem 152 (28%) 162 (31%) Drowsiness/sedation 112 (20%) 122 (23%) Headache 49 (9%) 27 (5%) Hypoxia 49 (9%) 35 (7%) Pyrexia 45 (8%) 34 (6%) Dizziness 36 (7%) 34 (6%) Gynecological disorder 36 (7%) 33 (6%) Anxiety/agitation 33 (6%) 29 (5%) Bradycardia 32 (6%) 30 (6%) Shiver(s) 28 (5%) 30 (6%) Urinary retention 28 (5%) 18 (3%) Hypotension 27 (5%) 32 (6%) Pruritus 27 (5%) 20 (4%) Preliminary observations in a small number of subjects suggest a higher incidence of headache when ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets are taken with water, when compared to without water. Observed During Clinical Practice: In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Observed During Clinical Practice In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of oral formulations of ondansetron. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular:Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal:Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic:In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary:Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological:There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular:Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General:Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary:Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions:Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory:Hiccups Neurological:Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin:Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders:Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1, 3 Tramadol Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4, 5 Chemotherapy Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover studying 76 patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. Use in Surgical Patients The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets have been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >= 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >= 50 mg/m2). Table 5.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron tablets were unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >= 5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and With Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse Reaction Adverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking Ondansetron injection (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.1) -QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) -Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4) (5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid Ondansetron injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Ondansetron injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Ondansetron injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Ondansetron injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of Ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablet in 2 trials.

Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving Ondansetron Hydrochloride Tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following have been reported as adverse events in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron hydrochloride. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron hydrochloride has been unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in >=5% of adult patients receiving a single 24 mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose >=50 mg/m2). Table 5. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: Single Day Therapy With 24 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 24 mg q.d. n = 300 Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 124 Ondansetron 32 mg q.d. n = 117 Headache 33 (11%) 16 (13%) 17 (15%) Diarrhea 13 (4%) 9 (7%) 3 (3%) The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in >=5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in U.S. Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8 mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy) Event Ondansetron 8 mg b.i.d. n = 242 Ondansetron 8 mg t.i.d. n = 415 Placebo n = 262 Headache 58 (24%) 113 (27%) 34 (13%) Malaise/fatigue 32 (13%) 37 (9%) 6 (2%) Constipation 22 (9%) 26 (6%) 1 (<1%) Diarrhea 15 (6%) 16 (4%) 10 (4%) Dizziness 13 (5%) 18 (4%) 12 (5%) Central Nervous System There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron. Hepatic In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined. There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear. Integumentary Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Other Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron hydrochloride was unclear. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron tablets and concurrent chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation, and diarrhea. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in >=5% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets at a dosage of 16 mg orally in clinical trials. With the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. Table 7.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron hydrochloride. Cardiovascular: Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurology: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions Skin: Urticaria Special Senses: Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apomorphine - profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. Concomitant use with ondansetron is contraindicated.(7.2) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. 7.2 Apomorphine Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Tramadol Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small studies indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these studies, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol. 7.5 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.6 Chemotherapy In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate. 7.7 Temazepam The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam. 7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reactions (>= 7%) in adults are diarrhea, headache, and fever. (6.1) Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting - The most common adverse reaction (>= 10%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in adults is headache.(6.1) The most common adverse reaction (>= 2%) which occurs at a higher frequency compared to placebo in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age is diarrhea.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ondansetron across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in > 5% of Adult Patients Who Received Ondansetron at a Dosage of Three 0.15-mg/kg Doses Adverse Reaction Number of Adult Patients with Reaction Ondansetron Injection 0.15 mg/kg x 3 n = 419 Metoclopramide n = 156 Placebo n = 34 Diarrhea 16% 44% 18% Headache 17% 7% 15% Fever 8% 5% 3% Cardiovascular:Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported. Gastrointestinal:Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron. Hepatic:In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. Integumentary:Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron. Neurological:There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure. Other:Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: The adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported in >= 2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in >= 2% (and with Greater Frequency than the Placebo Group) of Adult Patients Receiving Ondansetron at a Dosage of 4 mg Intravenous over 2 to 5 Minutes Adverse ReactionAdverse Reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications Ondansetron Injection 4 mg Intravenous n = 547 patients Placebo n = 547 patients Headache 92 (17%) 77 (14%) Drowsiness/sedation 44 (8%) 37 (7%) Injection site reaction 21 (4%) 18 (3%) Fever 10 (2%) 6 (1%) Cold sensation 9 (2%) 8 (1%) Pruritus 9 (2%) 3 (< 1%) Paresthesia 9 (2%) 2 (< 1%) Pediatric Use: Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ondansetron (2%) compared to placebo (<1%) in the 1 month to 24 month age group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron. Hepatobiliary: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Local Reactions: Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection. Lower Respiratory: Hiccups Neurological: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion. Skin: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Eye Disorders: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, have also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists.(5.1) QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid Ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (5.2) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.3) Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (5.4)(5.5) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 QT Prolongation Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In addition, post-marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention. 5.5 Effect on Peristalsis Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction."
