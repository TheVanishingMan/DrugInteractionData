        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Ophthalmic Adverse Reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] The most common adverse reactions (>=2 %) are local skin reactions, application site pain, application site pruritus, application site irritation, application site infection, periorbital edema, nasopharyngitis and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact LEO Pharma Inc. at 1-877-494-4536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to Picato(R) gel in 499 subjects with actinic keratosis, including 274 subjects exposed to Picato(R) gel field treatment (skin area of 25 cm2 in the face or scalp regions) at a concentration of 0.015% once daily for 3 consecutive days, and 225 subjects exposed to Picato(R) gel field treatment (skin area of 25 cm2 in the trunk or extremities regions) at a concentration of 0.05% once daily for 2 consecutive days. Local skin reactions, including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration were assessed within the selected treatment area and graded by the investigator on a scale of 0 to 4. A grade of 0 represented no reaction present in the treated area, and a grade of 4 indicated a marked and severe skin reaction that extended beyond the treated area. Table 1 Investigator Assessment of Maximal Local Skin Reactions in the Treatment Area during the 57 Days Post Treatment Period (face/scalp trials) Face and Scalp (n=545) Picato(R) gel, 0.015% once daily for 3 days Skin reactions Any Gradea > Baseline Grade 4 Picato(R) gel (n=274) Vehicle (n=271) Picato(R) gel (n=274) Vehicle (n=271) Erythema 258 (94%) 69 (25%) 66 (24%) 0 (0%) Flaking/Scaling 233 (85%) 67 (25%) 25 (9%) 0 (0%) Crusting 220 (80%) 46 (17%) 16 (6%) 0 (0%) Swelling 217 (79%) 11 (4%) 14 (5%) 0 (0%) Vesiculation/Pustulation 154 (56%) 1 (0%) 15 (5%) 0 (0%) Erosion/Ulceration 87 (32%) 3 (1%) 1 (0%) 0 (0%) aMild (grade 1), Moderate (grade 2-3) or Severe (grade 4). Table 2 Investigator Assessment of Maximal Local Skin Reactions in the Treatment Area during the 57 Days Post Treatment Period (trunk/extremities trials) Trunk and Extremities (n=457) Picato(R) gel, 0.05% once daily for 2 days Skin reactions Any Gradea > Baseline Grade 4 Picato(R) gel (n=225) Vehicle (n=232) Picato(R) gel (n=225) Vehicle (n=232) Erythema 207 (92%) 43 (19%) 34 (15%) 0 (0%) Flaking/Scaling 203 (90%) 44 (19%) 18 (8%) 0 (0%) Crusting 167 (74%) 23 (10%) 8 (4%) 0 (0%) Swelling 143 (64%) 13 (6%) 7 (3%) 0 (0%) Vesiculation/Pustulation 98 (44%) 2 (1%) 3 (1%) 0 (0%) Erosion/Ulceration 58 (26%) 6 (3%) 2 (1%) 0 (0%) aMild (grade 1), Moderate (grade 2-3) or Severe (grade 4). Local skin reactions typically occurred within 1 day of treatment initiation, peaked in intensity up to 1 week following completion of treatment, and resolved within 2 weeks for areas treated on the face and scalp, and within 4 weeks for areas treated on the trunk and extremities. Adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of subjects treated with Picato(R) gel and at a higher frequency than the vehicle are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3 Adverse reactions occurring in >= 2% of subjects treated with Picato(R) gel and at higher frequency than vehicle (face/scalp trials) Face/Scalp Adverse Reactions Picato(R) gel, 0.015% (N=274) Vehicle (N=271) Application Site Pain 42 (15%) 1 (0%) Application Site Pruritus 22 (8%) 3 (1%) Application Site Infection 7 (3%) 0 (0%) Periorbital Edema 7 (3%) 0 (0%) Headache 6 (2%) 3 (1%) Table 4 Adverse reactions occurring in >= 2% of subjects treated with Picato(R) gel and at higher frequency than vehicle (trunk/extremities trials) Trunk/Extremities Adverse Reactions Picato(R) gel, 0.05% (N=225) Vehicle (N=232) Application Site Pruritus 18 (8%) 0 (0%) Application Site Irritation 8 (4%) 1 (0%) Nasopharyngitis 4 (2%) 2 (1%) Application Site Pain 5 (2%) 0 (0%) Less common adverse reactions in subjects treated with Picato(R) gel included: eyelid edema, eye pain, conjunctivitis. A total of 108 subjects treated with Picato(R) gel on the face/scalp and 38 subjects treated on the trunk/extremities were followed for 12 months. Results from these studies did not change the safety profile of Picato(R) gel. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Picato(R) (ingenol mebutate) gel, 0.015% and 0.05%: hypersensitivity, allergic contact dermatitis, herpes zoster, chemical conjunctivitis, and corneal burn. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid treatment in the periocular area. Eye disorders, including severe eye pain, chemical conjunctivitis, corneal burn, eyelid edema, eyelid ptosis, periorbital edema can occur after exposure. Avoid accidental transfer of the drug into the eyes and to the periocular area. If accidental exposure occurs, flush eyes with water and seek medical care. (5.1) Local skin reactions can occur including severe reactions (e.g., vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration). Administration of Picato(R) gel is not recommended until skin is healed from any previous drug or surgical treatment. (5.3) 5.1 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Avoid treatment in the periocular area. Eye disorders, including severe eye pain, chemical conjunctivitis, corneal burn, eyelid edema, eyelid ptosis, periorbital edema can occur after exposure [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . To avoid transfer of the drug into the eyes and to the periocular area during and after application, patients should wash hands well after applying Picato(R) gel. If accidental exposure occurs, the area should be flushed with water and the patient should seek medical care as soon as possible. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and allergic contact dermatitis, have been reported post-marketing [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Picato(R) gel immediately and institute appropriate medical therapy. 5.3 Local Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions in the treated area, including erythema, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/postulation, and erosion/ulceration, can occur after topical application of Picato(R) gel [see Adverse Reactions (6 )]. Administration of Picato(R) gel is not recommended until the skin is healed from any previous drug or surgical treatment."
