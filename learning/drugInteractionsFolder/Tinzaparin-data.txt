        "Drug Interactions: Because of increased risk of bleeding, INNOHEP(R) should be used with caution in patients receiving oral anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors (e.g., salicylates, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, dextran, NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel), and thrombolytics. If coadministration is essential, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of these patients is advised (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Bleeding: Bleeding is the most common adverse event associated with INNOHEP(R) (tinzaparin sodium injection); however, the incidence of major bleeding is low. In clinical trials, the definition of major bleeding included bleeding accompanied by >=2 gram/dL decrease in hemoglobin, requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of blood products, or bleeding which was intracranial, retroperitoneal, or into a major prosthetic joint. The data are provided in Table 4. Table 4 Major Bleeding Events1 in Treatment of Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Pulmonary Embolism Indication Treatment Group 1 Treatment of Acute DVT With or Without PE INNOHEP(R) N=519 % Heparin N=524 % 1 INNOHEP(R) 175 IU/kg once daily SC. Unfractionated heparin initial IV bolus of 5,000 IU followed by continuous IV infusion adjusted to an aPTT of 1.5 to 2.5 or initial IV bolus of 50 IU/kg followed by continuous IV infusion adjusted to an aPTT of 2.0 to 3.0. In all groups treatment continued for approximately 6 to 8 days, and all patients received oral anticoagulant treatment commencing in the first 2 to 3 days. 2 Bleeding accompanied by >=2 gram/dL decline in hemoglobin, requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of blood products, or bleeding which was intracranial, retroperitoneal, or into a major prosthetic joint. 3 The 95% CI on the difference in major bleeding event rates (1.9%) was 0.33%, 3.47%. Major Bleeding Events2 0.83 2.73 Fatal or nonfatal hemorrhage from any tissue or organ can occur. The signs, symptoms, and severity will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding. Hemorrhagic complications may present as, but are not limited to, paralysis; paresthesia; headache, chest, abdomen, joint, muscle or other pain; dizziness; shortness of breath, difficult breathing or swallowing; swelling; weakness; hypotension, shock, or coma. Therefore, the possibility of hemorrhage should be considered in evaluating the condition of any anticoagulated patient with complaints which do not indicate an obvious diagnosis (see WARNINGS, Hemorrhage ). Thrombocytopenia: In clinical studies thrombocytopenia was identified in 1% of patients treated with INNOHEP(R). Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/mm3) occurred in 0.13% (see WARNINGS, Thrombocytopenia ). Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases: Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and/or alanine (ALT [SGPT]) aminotransferase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range have been reported in up to 8.8% and 13% for AST and ALT, respectively, of patients receiving tinzaparin sodium for the treatment of DVT. Similar increases in aminotransferase levels have also been observed in patients and healthy volunteers treated with heparin and other low molecular weight heparins. Such elevations are reversible and are rarely associated with increases in bilirubin (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). Local Reactions: Mild local irritation, pain, hematoma, and ecchymosis may follow SC injection of INNOHEP(R). Injection site hematoma has been reported in approximately 16% of patients treated with INNOHEP(R). Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur in association with INNOHEP(R) use (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Adverse Events: Adverse events with INNOHEP(R) or heparin reported at a frequency of >=1% in clinical trials with patients undergoing treatment for proximal DVT with or without PE, are provided in Table 5.

Spinal epidural hematoma in association with neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture with INNOHEP(R) has been reported. Spinal epidural hematoma with INNOHEP(R) administered at a therapeutic dose has been reported in at least one patient who had not received neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture."
