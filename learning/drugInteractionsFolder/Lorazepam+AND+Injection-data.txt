        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions, if they occur, are usually observed at the beginning of therapy and generally disappear on continued medication or upon decreasing the dose. In a sample of about 3,500 anxious patients, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam is sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). Less frequent adverse reactions are disorientation, depression, nausea, change in appetite, headache, sleep disturbance, agitation, dermatological symptoms, eye-function disturbance, together with various gastrointestinal symptoms and autonomic manifestations. The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Small decreases in blood pressure have been noted but are not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam. Transient amnesia or memory impairment has been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines."

        "Clinically Significant Drug Interactions The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam."

Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; S IADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam-glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 mcg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of Lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL a One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. b Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=130)a Any Study Event (1 or more)b 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 (<1%) Cardiovascular System Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive System Liver function tests abnormal Nausea Vomiting 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 (<1%) Nervous System Brain edema Coma Convulsion Somnolence Thinking abnormal 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) 2 (1.5%) 1 (<1%) Respiratory System Hyperventilation Hypoventilation Respiratory failure 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) 2 (1.5%) Terms not Classifiable Injection site reaction 1 (<1%) Urogenital System Cystitis 1 (<1%) Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL a The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. b Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85)a Diazepam (n=80)a Any Study Event (1 or more)b 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular System Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and Lymphatic System Hypochromic anemia Leukocytosis Thrombocythemia 0 0 0 1 (1.3%) 1 (1.3%) 1 (1.3%) Nervous System Coma Somnolence Stupor 1 (1.2%) 3 (3.5%) 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) 3 (3.8%) 0 Respiratory System Hypoventilation Apnea Respiratory failure Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) 1 (1.3%) 1 (1.3%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM - Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS ). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash, nausea, and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam."

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; S IADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

        "Clinically Significant Drug Interactions The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN A CONTROLLED DOSE-COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=130)One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85)The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. Diazepam (n=80) Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 ( 1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2 %) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF LORAZEPAM INJECTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF STATUS EPILEPTICUS Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. LOCAL EFFECTS Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). OTHER ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS WARNINGS Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam. Lorazepam is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis. Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants, may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. (See PRECAUTIONS, Clinically Significant Drug Interactions). Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence. As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving lorazepam should be warned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished. Physical And Psychological Dependence The use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of dependence increases with higher doses and longer term use and is further increased in patients with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse or in patients with significant personality disorders. The dependence potential is reduced when lorazepam is used at the appropriate dose for short-term treatment. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving lorazepam or other psychotropic agents. In general, benzodiazepines should be prescribed for short periods only (e.g. 2 to 4 weeks). Extension of the treatment period should not take place without reevaluation of the need for continued therapy. Continuous long-term use of product is not recommended. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. rebound insomnia) can appear following cessation of recommended doses after as little as one week of therapy. Abrupt discontinuation of product should be avoided and a gradual dosage-tapering schedule followed after extended therapy. Abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms reported following discontinuation of benzodiazepines include headache, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, rebound phenomena, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise, and physical contact/perceptual changes, involuntary movements, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, hallucinations/delirium, convulsions/seizures, tremor, abdominal cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, vertigo, hyperreflexia, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. Convulsions/seizures may be more common in patients with preexisting seizure disorders or who are taking other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold such as antidepressants. There is evidence that tolerance develops to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. Lorazepam may have abuse potential, especially in patients with a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse. PRECAUTIONS In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind; benzodiazepines should not be used in such patients without adequate antidepressant therapy. Lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea syndrome). Elderly or debilitated patients may be more susceptible to the sedative effects of lorazepam. Therefore, these patients should be monitored frequently and have their dosage adjusted carefully according to patient response; the initial dosage should not exceed 2 mg. Paradoxical reactions have been occasionally reported during benzodiazepine use. Such reactions may be more likely to occur in children and the elderly. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. The usual precautions for treating patients with impaired renal and hepatic function should be observed. As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; therefore, lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy. Dosage for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency should be adjusted carefully according to patient response; lower doses may be sufficient in such patients. In patients where gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disorders coexist with anxiety, it should be noted that lorazepam has not been shown to be of significant benefit in treating the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular component. Esophageal dilation occurred in rats treated with lorazepam for more than one year at 6 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose was 1.25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of 10 mg per day). The effect was reversible only when the treatment was withdrawn within two months of first observation of the phenomenon. The clinical significance of this is unknown. However, use of lorazepam for prolonged periods and in geriatric patients requires caution, and there should be frequent monitoring for symptoms of upper G.I. disease. Safety and effectiveness of lorazepam in children of less than 12 years have not been established. Information for Patients To assure the safe and effective use of lorazepam, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug. Essential Laboratory Tests Some patients on lorazepam have developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver-function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with lorazepam. No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed. Pregnancy Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. AIthough all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits which was not seen at lower doses. The clinical significance of the above findings is not known. However, an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and meprobamate) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because the use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, the use of lorazepam during this period should be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug. In humans, blood levels obtained from umbilical cord blood indicate placental transfer of lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide. Infants of mothers who ingested benzodiazepines for several weeks or more preceding delivery have been reported to have withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period. Symptoms such as hypoactivity, hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory depression, apnea, feeding problems, and impaired metabolic response to cold stress have been reported in neonates born of mothers who have received benzodiazepines during the late phase of pregnancy or at delivery. Nursing Mothers Lorazepam has been detected in human breast milk; therefore, it should not be administered to breast-feeding women, unless the expected benefit to the woman outweighs the potential risk to the infant. Sedation and inability to suckle have occurred in neonates of lactating mothers taking benzodiazepines. Infants of lactating mothers should be observed for pharmacological effects (including sedation and irritability). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Age does not appear to have a significant effect on lorazepam kinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal impairment, should be considered. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, and lower doses may be sufficient in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; S IADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria, slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions ATIVAN Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in ATIVAN dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of ATIVAN in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. ATIVAN dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of ATIVAN Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of ATIVAN Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to ATIVAN Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN A CONTROLLED DOSE-COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with ATIVAN Injection in a dose-comparison trial of ATIVAN 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event ATIVAN Injection (n=130)One hundred and thirty (130) patients received ATIVAN Injection. Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which ATIVAN Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event ATIVAN Injection (n=85)The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received ATIVAN Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. Diazepam (n=80) Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 ( 1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2 %) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for ATIVAN was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF ATIVAN INJECTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF STATUS EPILEPTICUS ATIVAN Injection, active comparators, and ATIVAN Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. ATIVAN Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which ATIVAN Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. LOCAL EFFECTS Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). OTHER ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of ATIVAN (lorazepam) Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of ATIVAN Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%).

Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam-glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 mcg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of Lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1.

Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85)a Diazepam (n=80)a Any Study Event (1 or more)b 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 a The number indicates the number of \"patient-episodes.\" Patient-episodes were used rather than \"patients\" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. b Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals.

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; S IADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN A CONTROLLED DOSE-COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=130) One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. Any Study Event (1 or more) Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85) The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. Diazepam (n=80) Any Study Event (1 or more) Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 ( 1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2 %) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF LORAZEPAM INJECTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF STATUS EPILEPTICUS Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. LOCAL EFFECTS Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). OTHER ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior have been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmias, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam injection dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formulation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 mcg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of Lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all patient-episodes. Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of centralnervous- system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administrated to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE-- Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM-- Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL-- Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM -- Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM -- Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE -- Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM -- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene, which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an upredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea).

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see "WARNINGS"). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg.

Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all"patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given.

These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM - Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam in central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 vs 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurredvision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resultedin pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see "CONTRAINDICATIONS"). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY," "WARNINGS," and "PRECAUTIONS"). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash, nausea, and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see "PRECAUTIONS"- General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see ). WARNINGS The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies.

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam-glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 mcg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of Lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Lorazepam Injection Event (n=130)a Any Study Event (1 or more)b 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital System Cystitis 1 ( <1%) a One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. b Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Lorazepam Injection Diazepam Event (n=85)a (n=80)a Any Study Event (1 or more)b 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 a The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. b Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM - Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash, nausea, and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in Lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of Lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam injection, is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam injection, in a dose-comparison trial of Lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL a. One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam injection, b. Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. Body System Event Lorazepam Injection, USP (n=130) a Any Study Event (1 or more) b 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive System Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL a. The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. b. Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. Body System Event Lorazepam Injection, USP (n=85) a Diazepam (n=80) a Any Study Event (1 or more) b 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for Lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-Marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection USP, for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events Body as a Whole- Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. Digestive System- Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. Metabolic and Nutritional- Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. Nervous System- Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. Respiratory System- Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. Terms not Classifiable- Infrequent: Injection site reaction. Urogenital System- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/ seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/ visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by Lorazepam."

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN A CONTROLLED DOSE-COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=130)One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85)The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. Diazepam (n=80) Any Study Event (1 or more)Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 ( 1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2 %) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF LORAZEPAM INJECTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF STATUS EPILEPTICUS Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. LOCAL EFFECTS Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). OTHER ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "Clinically Significant Drug Interactions The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam."

        "Drug Interactions Lorazepam Injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces additive depression of the central nervous system when administered with other CNS depressants such as ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations and irrational behavior has been observed. There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. Marked sedation, excessive salivation, ataxia, and, rarely, death have been reported with the concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam. Apnea, coma, bradycardia, arrhythmia, heart arrest, and death have been reported with the concomitant use of haloperidol and lorazepam. The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required. Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in lorazepam dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs. LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). LORAZEPAM-PROBENECID INTERACTION Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension, somnolence, and respiratory failure. INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN A CONTROLLED DOSE-COMPARISON CLINICAL TRIAL Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. TABLE 1. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN A DOSE COMPARISON CLINICL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=130) One hundred and thirty (130) patients received Lorazepam Injection. Any Study Event (1 or more) Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 16 (12.3%) Body as a whole Infection 1 ( <1%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (1.5%) Digestive system Liver function tests abnormal 1 ( <1%) Nausea 1 ( <1%) Vomiting 1 ( <1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Acidosis 1 ( <1%) Nervous system Brain edema 1 ( <1%) Coma 1 ( <1%) Convulsion 1 ( <1%) Somnolence 2 (1.5%) Thinking abnormal 1 ( <1%) Respiratory system Hyperventilation 1 ( <1%) Hypoventilation 1 ( <1%) Respiratory failure 2 (1.5%) Terms not classifiable Injection site reaction 1 ( <1%) Urogenital system Cystitis 1 ( <1%) COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS In two studies, patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode, given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients, i.e., from all "patient-episodes." Table 2 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. TABLE 2. NUMBER (%) OF STUDY EVENTS IN ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL Body System Event Lorazepam Injection (n=85) The number indicates the number of "patient-episodes." Patient-episodes were used rather than "patients" because a total of 7 patients were reenrolled for the treatment of a second episode of status: 5 patients received Lorazepam Injection on two occasions that were far enough apart to establish the diagnosis of status epilepticus for each episode, and, using the same time criterion, 2 patients received diazepam on two occasions. Diazepam (n=80) Any Study Event (1 or more) Totals are not necessarily the sum of the individual study events because a patient may report two or more different study events in the same body system. 14 (16.5%) 11 (13.8%) Body as a whole Headache 1 ( 1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Cardiovascular system Hypotension 2 (2.4%) 0 Hemic and lymphatic system Hypochromic anemia 0 1 (1.3%) Leukocytosis 0 1 (1.3%) Thrombocythemia 0 1 (1.3%) Nervous system Coma 1 (1.2 %) 1 (1.3%) Somnolence 3 (3.5%) 3 (3.8%) Stupor 1 (1.2%) 0 Respiratory system Hypoventilation 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.5%) Apnea 1 (1.2%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory failure 2 (2.4%) 1 (1.3%) Respiratory disorder 1 (1.2%) 0 These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally, age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF LORAZEPAM INJECTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF STATUS EPILEPTICUS Lorazepam Injection, active comparators, and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Frequent and Infrequent Study Events BODY AS A WHOLE - Infrequent: asthenia, chills, headache, infection. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM - Infrequent: abnormal liver function test, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting. METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL - Infrequent: acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased. NERVOUS SYSTEM - Infrequent: agitation, ataxia, brain edema, coma, confusion, convulsion, hallucinations, myoclonus, stupor, thinking abnormal, tremor. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - Frequent: apnea; Infrequent: hyperventilation, hypoventilation, respiratory disorder. TERMS NOT CLASSIFIABLE - Infrequent: injection site reaction. UROGENITAL SYSTEM- Infrequent: cystitis. Preanesthetic CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. LOCAL EFFECTS Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance, appropriate airway management may become necessary (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). OTHER ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Skin rash, nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, mania, irritability, restlessness, agitation, aggression, psychosis, hostility, rage, or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome, aggravation of pheochromocytoma, amnesia, apnea/respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, bradycardia, brain edema, coagulation disorder, coma, convulsion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart arrest/failure, heart block, liver damage, lung edema, lung hemorrhage, nervousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, paralysis, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, urinary incontinence, ventricular arrhythmia. Fatalities also have been reported, usually in patients on concomitant medications (e.g., respiratory depressants) and/or with other medical conditions (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Clinically Significant Drug Interactions The benzodiazepines, including Ativan (lorazepam), produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may results in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam."
