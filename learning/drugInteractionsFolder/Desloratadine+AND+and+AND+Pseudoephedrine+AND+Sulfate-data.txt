        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No specific interaction studies have been conducted with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors: Do not use. May potentiate the effect of pseudoephedrine on vascular system. (7.1) 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen (14) days of stopping such treatment because the action of pseudoephedrine a component of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release tablets on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.2 Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents The antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa, and reserpine, may be reduced by sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine. Exercise caution when using CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets with these agents. 7.3 Digitalis Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Exercise caution when using CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets with these agents. 7.4 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or azithromycin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Fluoxetine In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Cimetidine In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with cimetidine a histamine H2-receptor antagonist resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Increased intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] The most common adverse reactions (reported in >=2% of patients) were insomnia, headache, mouth dry, fatigue, somnolence, pharyngitis, dizziness, nausea, and anorexia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data described below are from 2 clinical trials with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets that included 1248 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, of which 414 patients received CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets twice daily for up to 2 weeks. The majority of patients were between 18 and <65 years of age with a mean age of 35.8 years and were predominantly women (64%). Patient ethnicity was 82% Caucasian, 9% Black, 6% Hispanic and 3% Asian/other ethnicity. The percentage of subjects receiving CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets and who discontinued from the clinical trials because of an adverse event was 3.6%. Adverse reactions that were reported by >=2% of subjects receiving CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions Reported by >=2% of Subjects Receiving CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets Adverse Reaction CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR BID (N=414) Desloratadine 5 mg QD (N=412) Pseudoephedrine 120 mg BID (N=422) Gastrointestinal Disorders Mouth Dry 8% 2% 8% Nausea 2% 1% 3% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 4% 2% 2% Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Anorexia 2% 0% 2% Nervous System Disorders Headache 8% 8% 9% Somnolence 3% 4% 2% Dizziness 3% 2% 2% Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 10% 3% 13% Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Pharyngitis 3% 3% 3% There were no relevant differences in adverse reactions for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and listed above, adverse events have been identified during post approval use of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse events identified from post-marketing surveillance on the use of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets include tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, rash and pruritus. In addition to these events, the following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine as a single ingredient product: headache, somnolence, dizziness and rarely hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin and, very rarely, hepatitis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular and central nervous system effects: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders. (5.1) Coexisting conditions: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism. (5.2) 5.1 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects The pseudoephedrine sulfate contained in CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets, like other sympathomimetic amines, can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects in some patients such as insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias. In addition, central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has been reported. Therefore, CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, and should not be used in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease. 5.2 Coexisting Conditions CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets contain pseudoephedrine sulfate, a sympathomimetic amine, and therefore should be used with caution in patients with diabetes and hyperthyroidism. Also use with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or increased intraocular pressure, as urinary retention and narrow-angle glaucoma may occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Co-Administration with Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen (14) days of stopping such treatment as an increase in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis, may occur [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have been reported after administration of desloratadine a component of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be stopped and alternative treatment should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Renal Impairment CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]."
