        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label: Seizures [(see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Intracranial Hypertension [(see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Impaired Neurosurgical Wound Healing [(see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Meningitis [(see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Newly-Diagnosed High-Grade Malignant Glioma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10% and between arm difference >=4%) are cerebral edema, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, wound healing abnormalities and depression (6.1). Recurrent High-Grade Malignant Glioma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10% and between arm difference >=4%) are urinary tract infection, wound healing abnormalities and fever (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-866-516-4950 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Newly-Diagnosed High-Grade Malignant Glioma The safety of GLIADEL Wafers was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 240 adult patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma who received up to eight GLIADEL Wafers or matched placebo implanted against the resection surfaces after maximal tumor resection (Study 1). The population in Study 1 was 67% male and 97% White, and the median age was 53 years (range: 21-72). Eighty-seven percent had a Karnofsky performance status >= 70 and 71% had a Karnofsky performance status of >= 80%. Seventy-eight percent had a histologic subtype of glioblastoma multiforme as determined by central pathology review. Thirty-eight percent of patients received 8 wafers and 78% received >= 6 wafers. Starting three weeks after surgery, 80% of patients received standard limited field radiation therapy (RT) described as 55-60 Gy delivered in 28 to 30 fractions over six weeks; an additional 11% received no radiotherapy and the remainder received non-standard radiotherapy or a combination of standard and non-standard radiotherapy. At the time of progression, 12% received systemic chemotherapy. Deaths occurred within 30 days of wafer implantation in 5 (4%) of patients receiving GLIADEL Wafers compared to 2 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. Deaths on the GLIADEL arm resulted from cerebral hematoma/edema (n=3), pulmonary embolism (n=1) and acute coronary event (n=1). Deaths on the placebo arm resulted from sepsis (n=1) and malignant disease (n=1). The incidence of common adverse reactions in GLIADEL Wafer-treated patients is listed in Table 1. The incidence of local adverse reactions is shown in Table 2. Table 1.

Patients were required to have had prior definitive external beam radiation therapy sufficient to disqualify them from additional radiation therapy. All patients were eligible to receive chemotherapy which was withheld at least four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas) prior to and two weeks after surgery. The population in Study 2 was 64% male, 92% White, and the median age was 49 years (range: 19-80). Sixty-five percent had a histologic subtype of glioblastoma multiforme, 26% had anaplastic astrocytoma or another anaplastic variant, 73% had a Karnofsky performance status >= 70, 53% had a Karnofsky performance status of >= 80%, 73% had only one prior surgery, and 46% had prior treatment with nitrosourea. Eighty-one percent of patients received 8 wafers and 96% received >= 6 wafers. Sixty-four severe adverse reactions were reported in 43(39%) patients receiving GLIADEL Wafers. Adverse reactions in GLIADEL Wafer-treated patients are shown in Table 3. Meningitis occurred in four patients receiving GLIADEL Wafers and in no patients receiving placebo. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in two patients: the first with onset four days following GLIADEL Wafer implantation; the second following resection for tumor recurrence 155 days following GLIADEL Wafer implantation. One case, attributed to chemical meningitis resolved following steroid treatment. The cause of the fourth case was undetermined but resolved following antibiotic treatment. Table 3.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Seizures: Monitor patients for seizures following implantation (5.1). Intracranial hypertension: Monitor patients for signs of increased intracranial pressure (5.2). Impaired neurosurgical wound healing: Monitor patients for complications of craniotomy (5.3). Meningitis: Monitor patients for signs of bacterial or chemical meningitis (5.4). Wafer migration: Monitor patients for signs of obstructive hydrocephalus (5.5). Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm (5.6) 5.1 Seizures Seizures occurred in 37% of patients treated with GLIADEL Wafers for recurrent glioma in Study 2. New or worsening (treatment emergent) seizures occurred in 20% of patients; 54% of treatment emergent seizures occurred within the first 5 post-operative days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The median time to onset of the first new or worsened post-operative seizure was four days. Institute optimal anti-seizure therapy prior to surgery. Monitor patients for seizures postoperatively. 5.2 Intracranial Hypertension Brain edema occurred in 23% of patients with newly diagnosed glioma treated with GLIADEL Wafers in Study 1. Additionally, one GLIADEL-treated patient experienced intracerebral mass effect unresponsive to corticosteroids which led to brain herniation (see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ). Monitor patients closely for intracranial hypertension related to brain edema, inflammation, or necrosis of the brain tissue surrounding the resection. In refractory cases, consider re-operation and removal of GLIADEL Wafers or Wafer remnants. 5.3 Impaired Neurosurgical Wound Healing Impaired neurosurgical wound healing including wound dehiscence, delayed wound healing, and subdural, subgleal, or wound effusions occur with GLIADEL Wafer treatment. In Study 1, 16% of GLIADEL Wafer-treated patients with newly diagnosed glioma experienced impaired intracranial wound healing and 5% had cerebrospinal fluid leaks. In Study 2, 14% of GLIADEL Wafer-treated patients with recurrent glioma experienced wound healing abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor patients post-operatively for impaired neurosurgical wound healing. 5.4 Meningitis Meningitis occurred in 4% of patients with recurrent glioma receiving GLIADEL Wafers in Study 2. Two cases of meningitis were bacterial; one patient required removal of the Wafers four days after implantation; the other developed meningitis following reoperation for recurrent tumor. One case was diagnosed as chemical meningitis and resolved following steroid treatment. In one case the cause was unspecified, but meningitis resolved following antibiotic treatment. Monitor postoperatively for signs of meningitis and central nervous system infection. 5.5 Wafer Migration GLIADEL Wafer migration can occur. To reduce the risk of obstructive hydrocephalus due to wafer migration into the ventricular system, close any communication larger than the diameter of a Wafer between the surgical resection cavity and the ventricular system prior to Wafer implantation. Monitor patients for signs of obstructive hydrocephalus. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity GLIADEL Wafers can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Carmustine, the active component of GLIADEL Wafer, is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats at exposures less than the exposure at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis and embryotoxic in rabbits at exposures similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy after implantation of GLIADEL Wafers. If the patient becomes pregnant after GLIADEL Wafer implantation, warn the patient about the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.6) ]."

These occurred at varying time intervals post-implantation. Cyst formation has also been reported in patients following resection of malignant glioma who have not had Gliadel(R) implanted. The following four categories of adverse events are possibly related to treatment with GLIADEL(R) Wafer. The frequency with which they occurred in the randomized trials along with descriptive detail is provided below. 1. Seizures: In the initial surgery trial, the incidence of seizures was 33.3% in patients receiving GLIADEL(R) Wafer and 37.5% in patients receiving placebo. Grand mal seizures occurred in 5% of GLIADEL(R) Wafer-treated patients and 4.2% of placebo treated patients. The incidence of seizures within the first 5 days after wafer implantation was 2.5% in the GLIADEL(R) Wafer group and 4.2% in the placebo group. The time from surgery to the onset of the first post-operative seizure did not differ between the GLIADEL(R) Wafer and placebo treated patients. In the surgery for recurrent disease trial, the incidence of post-operative seizures was 19% in both patients receiving GLIADEL(R) Wafer and placebo. In this study, 12/22 (54%) of patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer and 2/22 (9%) of placebo patients experienced the first new or worsened seizure within the first five post-operative days. The median time to onset of the first new or worsened post-operative seizure was 3.5 days in patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer and 61 days in placebo patients. 2. Brain Edema: In the initial surgery trial, brain edema was noted in 22.5% of patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer and in 19.2% of patients treated with placebo. Development of brain edema with mass effect (due to tumor recurrence, intracranial infection, or necrosis) may necessitate re-operation and, in some cases, removal of GLIADEL(R) Wafer or its remnants. 3. Healing Abnormalities: The following healing abnormalities have been reported in clinical trials of GLIADEL(R) Wafer: wound dehiscence, delayed wound healing, subdural, subgaleal or wound effusions, and cerebrospinal fluid leak. In the initial surgery trial, healing abnormalities occurred in 15.8% of GLIADEL(R) Wafer treated patients and in 11.7% of placebo recipients. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred in 5% of GLIADEL(R) Wafer recipients and 0.8% of those given placebo. During surgery, a water-tight dural closure should be obtained to minimize the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak. In the surgery for recurrent disease trial, the incidence of healing abnormalities was 14% in GLIADEL(R) Wafer treated patients and 5% in patients receiving placebo wafers. 4. Intracranial Infection: In the initial surgery trial, the incidence of brain abscess or meningitis was 5% in patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer and 6% in patients receiving placebo. In the recurrent setting, the incidence of brain abscess or meningitis was 4% in patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer and 1% in patients receiving placebo. The following adverse events, not listed in the table above, were reported in less than 4% but at least 1% of patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer in all studies. The events listed were either not present pre-operatively or worsened post-operatively. Whether GLIADEL(R) Wafer caused these events cannot be determined. Body as a Whole: peripheral edema (2%); neck pain (2%); accidental injury (1%); back pain (1%); allergic reaction (1%); asthenia (1%); chest pain (1%); sepsis (1%) Cardiovascular System: hypertension (3%); hypotension (1%) Digestive System: diarrhea (2%); constipation (2%); dysphagia (1%); gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1%); fecal incontinence (1%) Hemic and Lymphatic System: thrombocytopenia (1%); leukocytosis (1%) Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hyponatremia (3%); hyperglycemia (3%); hypokalemia (1%) Musculoskeletal System: infection (1%) Nervous System: hydrocephalus (3%); depression (3%); abnormal thinking (2%); ataxia (2%); dizziness (2%); insomnia (2%); monoplegia (2%); coma (1%); amnesia (1%); diplopia (1%); paranoid reaction (1%). In addition, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarct were each reported in less than 1% of patients treated with GLIADEL(R) Wafer. Respiratory System: infection (2%); aspiration pneumonia (1%) Skin and Appendages: rash (2%) Special Senses: visual field defect (2%); eye pain (1%) Urogenital System: urinary incontinence (2%)"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Pulmonary Toxicity Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur from 9 days to 43 months after treatment with BiCNU and related nitrosoureas. Most of these patients were receiving prolonged therapy with total doses of BiCNU greater than 1400 mg/m2. However, there have been reports of pulmonary fibrosis in patients receiving lower total doses. Other risk factors include past history of lung disease and duration of treatment. Cases of fatal pulmonary toxicity with BiCNU have been reported. Additionally, delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in a long-term study with 17 patients who received BiCNU in childhood and early adolescence (1-16 years) in cumulative doses ranging from 770 to 1800 mg/m2 combined with cranial radiotherapy for intracranial tumors. Chest x-rays demonstrated pulmonary hypoplasia with upper zone contraction. Gallium scans were normal in all cases. Thoracic CT scans have demonstrated an unusual pattern of upper zone fibrosis. There was some late reduction of pulmonary function in all long-term survivors. This form of lung fibrosis may be slowly progressive and has resulted in death in some cases. In this long-term study, 8 of 17 died of delayed pulmonary lung fibrosis, including all those initially treated (5 of 17) at less than 5 years of age. Hematologic Toxicity A frequent and serious toxicity of BiCNU is delayed myelosuppression. It usually occurs 4 to 6 weeks after drug administration and is dose related. Thrombocytopenia occurs at about 4 weeks postadministration and persists for 1 to 2 weeks. Leukopenia occurs at 5 to 6 weeks after a dose of BiCNU and persists for 1 to 2 weeks. Thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia. However, both may be dose-limiting toxicities. BiCNU may produce cumulative myelosuppression, manifested by more depressed indices or longer duration of suppression after repeated doses. The occurrence of acute leukemia and bone marrow dysplasias has been reported in patients following long-term nitrosourea therapy. Anemia also occurs, but is less frequent and less severe than thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. Greater myelotoxicity (e.g., leukopenia and neutropenia) has been reported when carmustine was combined with cimetidine (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Gastrointestinal Toxicity Nausea and vomiting after intravenous administration of BiCNU are noted frequently. This toxicity appears within 2 hours of dosing, usually lasting 4 to 6 hours, and is dose related. Prior administration of antiemetics is effective in diminishing and sometimes preventing this side effect. Hepatotoxicity A reversible type of hepatic toxicity, manifested by increased transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, has been reported in a small percentage of patients receiving BiCNU. Nephrotoxicity Renal abnormalities consisting of progressive azotemia, decrease in kidney size, and renal failure have been reported in patients who received large cumulative doses after prolonged therapy with BiCNU and related nitrosoureas. Kidney damage has also been reported occasionally in patients receiving lower total doses. Other Toxicities Accidental contact of reconstituted BiCNU with skin has caused burning and hyperpigmentation of the affected areas. Rapid intravenous infusion of BiCNU may produce intensive flushing of the skin and suffusion of the conjunctiva within 2 hours, lasting about 4 hours. It is also associated with burning at the site of injection although true thrombosis is rare. Local soft tissue toxicity has been reported following extravasation of BiCNU. Infiltration of BiCNU may result in swelling, pain, erythema, burning sensation, and skin necrosis. Neuroretinitis, chest pain, headache, allergic reaction, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported as part of ongoing surveillance."
