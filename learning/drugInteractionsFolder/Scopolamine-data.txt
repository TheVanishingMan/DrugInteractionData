Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Elderly patients may react with symptoms of excitement, agitation, drowsiness, and other untoward manifestations to even small doses of the drug. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The absorption of oral medications may be decreased during the concurrent use of scopolamine because of decreased gastric motility and delayed gastric emptying. [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Scopolamine should be used with caution in patients taking other drugs that are capable of causing CNS effects such as sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol. Special attention should be paid to potential interactions with drugs having anticholinergic properties; e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, antihistamines (including meclizine), tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants. In vitro studies indicated that the potential for scopolamine to alter the pharmacokinetics of other concomitant medications through inhibition of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 or induction of CYP 1A2 and 3A4 is low; however, in vivo studies have not been conducted. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Absorption of oral medications may be decreased (7) Use with care while taking sedatives, tranquilizers or alcohol (7) Potential interactions with drugs having anticholinergic properties (7) Scopolamine interferes with the gastric secretion test (7.1) 7.1 Laboratory Test Interactions Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during motion sickness clinical trials are dry mouth, drowsiness and blurred vision. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions during PONV trials (>= than 3%) are dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, urinary retention, agitation, visual impairment, confusion, mydriasis and pharyngitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. at 1-800-452-0051 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Motion Sickness In motion sickness clinical studies of Transderm Scōp, the most frequent adverse reaction was dry mouth. This occurred in about two thirds of patients on drug. A less frequent adverse drug reaction was drowsiness, which occurred in less than one sixth of patients on drug. Transient impairment of eye accommodation, including blurred vision and dilation of the pupils, was also observed. Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting In a total of five clinical studies in which Transderm Scōp was administered perioperatively to a total of 461 patients where safety was assessed, dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse drug reaction, which occurred in approximately 29% of patients on drug. Dizziness was reported by approximately 12% of patients on drug. Other adverse drug reactions reported from these studies, with a frequency of >=3% of patients treated with Transderm Scop and with a frequency higher than placebo were, in descending order: somnolence, urinary retention, agitation/restlessness, visual impairment, confusion, mydriasis and pharyngitis (see Table 6.1). Table 6.1 PONV: Adverse Drug Reactions in >=3% of Patients Transderm Scōp (N=461) Placebo (N=457) n % n % Adverse Drug Reactions 303 65.7 259 56.7 Dry mouth 133 28.9 72 15.8 Dizziness 57 12.4 33 7.2 Somnolence 36 7.8 16 3.5 Urinary Retention 33 7.2 30 6.6 Agitation 28 6.1 20 4.4 Visual Impairment 23 5.0 12 2.6 Confusion 18 3.9 14 3.1 Mydriasis 16 3.5 2 0.4 Pharyngitis 15 3.3 10 2.2 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions, further to those reported from clinical trials, have been identified during postapproval use of Transderm Scop. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to confirm a definite causal relationship. In worldwide marketing with Transderm Scōp, the following adverse drug reactions were reported by body system. Psychiatric disorders: acute psychosis including: hallucinations disorientation, and paranoia. Nervous system disorders: headache, amnesia, coordination abnormalities, speech disorder, disturbance in attention, restlessness. General disorders and administration site conditions: application site burning. Eye disorders: dry eyes, eye pruritis, angle closure glaucoma, amblyopia, eyelid irritation. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash generalized, skin irritation, erythema. Renal and urinary disorders: dysuria. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: vertigo. 6.3 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension may occur following abrupt discontinuation of anticholinergic drugs such as Transderm Scōp. Similar symptoms, including disturbances of equilibrium, have been reported in some patients following discontinuation of use of the Transderm Scōp system. These symptoms usually do not appear until 24 hours or more after the patch has been removed. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention. Some symptoms may be related to adaptation from a motion environment to a motion-free environment. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use with caution in patients with open angle glaucoma (5.1) Stop use if patient experiences symptoms of angle closure glaucoma (5.1, 6.2) Can cause temporary dilation and blurred vision if scopolamine contacts the eyes (5.2, 6, 16) Use caution in patients with a history of seizures or psychosis (5.4) Use with caution in patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction, or patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction (5.3) Stop use if patient has difficulty urinating (5.3, 6) Idiosyncratic reactions, such as confusion, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia and delusions, may occur with therapeutic doses of scopolamine (5.5, 6.2) A safe and effective dose has not been established in the pediatric population (5.6, 8.4) Use with caution in the elderly because of the increased likelihood of CNS effects, such as hallucinations, confusion and dizziness (5.6, 8.5) Should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function because of the increased likelihood of CNS effects (5.6, 8.5, 8.6) May cause drowsiness or disorienting effects, therefore patients should be cautioned against engaging in activities that require mental alertness, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating dangerous machinery (5.7) Skin burns have been reported in patients undergoing MRI testing (5.8) 5.1 Open Angle Glaucoma Patients currently being treated for Open Angle Glaucoma Glaucoma therapy in patients with open angle glaucoma should be monitored and may need to be adjusted during Transderm Scōp use, as the mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure. Patients should be advised to remove the patch immediately and promptly contact a physician in the event that they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils). 5.2 Temporary Dilation of the Pupil Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils and blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Patients should be strongly advised to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling the patch. [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ] In addition, it is important that used patches be disposed of properly to avoid contact with children or pets. [ see How Supplied/ Storage and Handling (16) ] 5.3 Preexisting Gastrointestinal or Urinary Bladder Obstructions Transderm Scōp should be used with caution in patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction. Caution should be exercised when administering an antiemetic or anticholinergic drug, including Transderm Scōp, to patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction. Patients should be instructed to remove the patch if they develop any difficulties in urinating. [see Adverse Reactions (6)] 5.4 History of Seizures or Psychosis Transderm Scōp should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or psychosis since scopolamine can potentially aggravate both disorders. 5.5 Idiosyncratic Reactions Idiosyncratic reactions may occur with ordinary therapeutic doses of scopolamine. The most serious of these that have been reported are: acute toxic psychosis, including confusion, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions. [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.6 Specific Populations Pediatric A safe and effective dose has not been established in the pediatric population [ see Use in Specific Populations(8.4) ]. Children are particularly susceptible to the side effects of belladonna alkaloids; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amyblyopia, and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported when one half or one quarter of a patch has been applied. Elderly Transderm Scōp should be used with caution in the elderly because of the increased likelihood of CNS effects, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome. Clinical trials of Transderm Scop did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] Renal and Hepatic Impaired Transderm Scōp should be used with caution in individuals with impaired renal or hepatic functions because of the increased likelihood of CNS effects. Transderm Scop has not been studied in these populations. [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.7 Safety Hazards Drowsiness Since drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion may occur with the use of scopolamine, patients should be warned of the possibility and cautioned against engaging in activities that require mental alertness, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating dangerous machinery. Disorienting Effects Patients who expect to participate in underwater sports should be cautioned regarding the potentially disorienting effects of scopolamine. [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.8 MRI Skin Burns Skin burns have been reported at the patch site in several patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan (MRI). Because Transderm Scōp contains aluminum, it is recommended to remove the system before undergoing an MRI."

Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Elderly patients may react with symptoms of excitement, agitation, drowsiness, and other untoward manifestations to even small doses of the drug. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions."

        "Drug Interactions: Do not take this product if you are presently taking, or have taken within the preceding two weeks, a prescription drug for high blood pressure or depression without first consulting your physician. Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Combinations containing any of the following medications, depending on the amount present, may also interact with this product: - Alkalizers, such as: calcium and/or magnesium-containing antacids; Carbonic inhibitors; citrates; sodium bicarbonate-urinary excretion of anticholinergics may be delayed by alkalization of the urine, thus potentiating scopolamine methyl nitrate therapeutic and/or side effects. - Antacids or adsorbent antidiarrheals-simultaneous use of these medications may reduce absorption of scopolamine methyl nitrate, resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness; doses of these should be spaced 2 or 3 hours apart from doses of scopolamine methyl nitrate. - Anticholinergics - Concurrent use with anticholinergic effects; patients should be advised to report occurrence of gastrointestinal problems promptly since paralytic ileus may occur with concurrent therapy. - CNS Depressants - Concurrent use of alcohol, antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect. - Ketoconazole - Anticholinergics may increase gastrointestinal pH, possibly resulting in a marked reduction in ketoconazole absorption during concurrent use with anticholinergics; patients should be advised to take these medications at least 2 hours after ketoconazole. - MAO inhibitors - Concurrent use may prolong and intensify cardiac stimulate and vasopressor effects of chlorpheniramine, resulting in headache, cardiac arrhythmias, vomiting or sudden and severe hypertensive and/or hyperpyretic crisis. These medications should not be administered during or within 14 days following the administration of MAO inhibitor therapy. - Metoclopramide - Concurrent use of metoclopramide with anticholinergics may antagonize metoclopramide's effects on gastrointestinal motility. - Potassium chloride - Concurrent use with anticholinergics may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS: The following adverse reactions have been observed with the use of chlorpheniramine and scopolamine methyl nitrate; Arrhytmias, blood dyscrasias, CNS depression, CNS stimulation, dizziness, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, hallucinations, hypotension, hypertension, increased sweating, loss of appetite, paradoxical reaction, restlessness, skin rash, stomach upset or pain, thickening of mucus, tingling in hands or feet, trembling, troubled breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting. Note: Agitation; confusion; difficult or painful urination; drowsiness; dizziness; and dryness of mouth, nose and throat are more likely to occur in the elderly. Nightmares, unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability are more likely to occur in children and the elderly. When anticholinergics are given to patients, especially children, where the environmental temperature is high, there is risk of a rapid increase in body temperature."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS With nearly all antimuscarinic drugs, dry mouth is the first and dry skin is the second most common side effect. Thirst and difficulty in swallowing occur when the mouth and esophagus become sufficiently dry; chronic dry mouth also fosters dental caries. Suppression of sweating causes reflexive flushing and heat intolerance and can result in heat exhaustion or heat stroke in a hot environment; it also contributes to the hyperthermia seen in intoxication. Mydriasis frequently occurs, especially with scopolamine; photophobia and blurring of vision are consequences of mydriasis. Cycloplegia (which exacerbates blurred vision) occurs approximately concomitantly with mydriasis, but usually higher doses are required. In susceptible persons, especially the elderly, cycloplegia may contribute to an elevation of intraocular pressure. Difficulty in urination and urinary retention may occur. Tachycardia is a common side effect. Constipation, even bowel stasis, may occur. In the larger therapeutic doses, scopolamine may cause dizziness, restlessness, tremors, fatigue and locomotor difficulties."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE DRUG EXPERIENCES The adverse reactions for Transderm Scōp are provided separately for patients with motion sickness and with post-operative nausea and vomiting. Motion Sickness: In motion sickness clinical studies of Transderm Scōp, the most frequent adverse reaction was dryness of the mouth. This occurred in about two thirds of patients on drug. A less frequent adverse drug reaction was drowsiness, which occurred in less than one sixth of patients on drug. Transient impairment of eye accommodation, including blurred vision and dilation of the pupils, was also observed. Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting: In a total of five clinical studies in which Transderm Scōp was administered perioperatively to a total of 461 patients and safety was assessed, dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse drug experience, which occurred in approximately 29% of patients on drug. Dizziness was reported by approximately 12% of patients on drug6. Postmarketing and Other Experience: In addition to the adverse experiences reported during clinical testing of Transderm Scōp, the following are spontaneously reported adverse events from postmarketing experience. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of Transderm Scōp in their causation cannot be reliably determined: acute angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma; confusion; difficulty urinating; dry, itchy, or conjunctival injection of eyes; restlessness; hallucinations; memory disturbances; rashes and erythema; and transient changes in heart rate. Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms: Symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and headache occur following abrupt discontinuation of antimuscarinics. Similar symptoms, including disturbances of equilibrium, have been reported in some patients following discontinuation of use of the Transderm Scōp system. These symptoms usually do not appear until 24 hours or more after the patch has been removed. Some symptoms may be related to adaptation from a motion environment to a motion-free environment. More serious symptoms including muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension may occur following discontinuation of Transderm Scōp."
