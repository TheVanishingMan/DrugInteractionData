 27293361   Neetu TJ, Murugan S (2016) "Genotyping of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus from Tertiary Care Hospitals in Coimbatore, South India." J Glob Infect Dis 8(2), 68-74

BACKGROUND: Globally, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
is one of the most common pathogens that causes hospital- and community-acquired
infections. The use of molecular typing methods is essential for determining
the  origin of the isolates, their clonal relations, and also epidemiological
investigations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant MRSA investigate the accessory
gene regulator  (agr) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)
types and perform multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, the
minimum inhibitory concentration of MRSA isolates was determined for
vancomycin and daptomycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-nine
MRSA isolates were collected from Tertiary Care Hospitals in Coimbatore.
Disk diffusion method was employed to assess the sensitivity of MRSA
isolates to selected antibiotics and genetic analysis was performed
using SCCmec, agr, and MLST typing by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction
strategy. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using
Ezy MIC (vancomycin) and Biomerieux (daptomycin) E-test strip. RESULTS:
Of  259 MRSA isolates, 209 (80.7%) were confirmed as methicillin resistant.
Antibiotic susceptibility pattern revealed that all the MRSA isolates
were 100% sensitive to linezolid, rifampicin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin.
MIC results showed that of 209 MRSA isolates, 10 were found to be vancomycin
intermediate S.  aureus and 100% of the MRSA isolates were daptomycin-susceptible.
The agr group I and SCCmec Type III were the major type among MRSA
isolates. In addition to these MLST typing revealed the prevalence
of sequence type (ST) 239 (SLV of ST8) among  the MRSA isolates. CONCLUSION:
This study confirms that ST239 (Brazilian clone) of MRSA is predominant
in this region which is responsible for the hospital-acquired MRSA
infections. Thus, the study also suggests that vancomycin  and daptomycin
can still be used as an alternative drug for treating severe MRSA  infections.

 27292911   Weiser J et al (2016) "Sub-inhibitory tigecycline concentrations induce extracellular matrix binding protein Embp dependent Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation and immune evasion." Int J Med Microbiol

Biofilm-associated Staphylococcus epidermidis implant infections are
notoriously  reluctant to antibiotic treatment. Here we studied the
effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin,
daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline on S. epidermidis 1585 biofilm
formation, expression of extracellular matrix binding protein (Embp)
and potential implications for S. epidermidis - macrophage interactions.
Penicillin, vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid had no biofilm augmenting
effect at any of the concentrations tested. In contrast, at sub-inhibitory
concentrations tigecycline and oxacillin exhibited significant biofilm
inducing activity. In S. epidermidis 1585, SarA is a negative regulator
of giant 1 MDa Embp, and down regulation of sarA induces Embp-dependent
assembly  of a multi-layered biofilm architecture. Dot blot immune
assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and qPCR showed that under
biofilm inducing conditions, tigecycline augmented embp expression
compared to the control grown without antibiotics. Conversely, expression
of regulator sarA was suppressed, suggesting  that tigecycline exerts
its effects on embp expression through SarA. Tigecycline  failed to
induce biofilm formation in embp transposon mutant 1585-M135, proving
that under these conditions Embp up-regulation is necessary for biofilm
accumulation. As a functional consequence, tigecycline induced biofilm
formation  significantly impaired the up-take of S. epidermidis by
mouse macrophage-like cell line J774A.1. Our data provide novel evidence
for the molecular basis of antibiotic induced biofilm formation, a
phenotype associated with inherently increased antimicrobial tolerance.
While this could explain failure of antimicrobial therapies, persistence
of S. epidermidis infections in the presence of sub-inhibitory antimicrobials
is additionally propelled by biofilm-related impairment of macrophage-mediated
pathogen eradication.

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is associated with human skin and
soft tissue infections (SSTIs); however, the involvement of virulence
factors in different clinical presentations is unclear. METHODS: We
analyzed methicillin-resistant S.  aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive
S. aureus (MSSA) strains from Taiwan to determine correlations among
the clinical characteristics of SSTIs, antimicrobial susceptibility
and virulence factors of S. aureus with specific genetic backgrounds.
RESULTS: We identified 177 MRSA isolates and 130 MSSA isolates among
the 307 SSTI-associated S. aureus isolates. Hospital-acquired (HA)-
and community-acquired (CA)-MRSA isolates accounted for 61.6 % and
38.4 % of the isolates, respectively. Clinical presentations in SSTI
patients differed significantly for the disease groups. Deep-seated
MRSA infections presented with  higher amputation rate than MSSA infections.
MRSA isolates were all susceptible to linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin,
and >94 % of isolates were erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant.
Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) types IV, V, and VII were
the most frequent in the CA-MRSA group (n = 68); types III, IV and
V were the most frequent in the HA-MRSA group (n = 109). Panton-Valentine
leukocidin (PVL) genes were significantly more frequent in CA-MRSA
strains (75.0 %) than in HA-MRSA (33.0 %) and MSSA (24.6 %) and were
found in 66.7 % (74/111) strains isolated from the abscess group. Exfoliatin
A genes were more common in catheter-related exit-site MSSA infections
(37.5 %) compared with other MSSA disease groups (P < 0.05). Exfoliatin
B and superantigen exotoxin genes were uncommon in all SSTI disease
types. Pulsotypes A (ST239), C,  and D (ST59) were the predominant
MRSA genotypes in deep-seated infections. CONCLUSIONS: If not treated
appropriately, deep-seated MRSA-associated infections present with
higher amputation rates than deep-seated MSSA-associated infections.
PVL-positive MRSA strains caused more frequently pus-forming lesions
and less bacteremia and invasive diseases. Methods for discriminating
CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA strains are now unreliable due to circulation
of both ST 239 and ST 59 strains in the community and nosocomial settings.
Initial antibiotic treatments should consider MRSA for patients with
SSTIs in areas where MRSA is prevalent.

 27280980   Tandon R, Nath M (2016) "Tackling drug-resistant tuberculosis: Current trends and approaches." Mini Rev Med Chem

Tuberculosis is very much rampant in our society and accounts for a
large number  of deaths annually. In spite of consistent efforts being
made, the disease has not been curtailed yet. The emergence of MDR
and XDR strains in the society along with an increase in the number
of HIV cases and that of latent TB, have further aggravated the problem
making the disease very much persistent. The current situation clearly
manifests the need to discover and develop new potent molecules/approaches
that could help to tackle drug resistance. Various molecules, such
as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin
and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid,
sutezolid/ PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal
azoles, pyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole
(OPC67683, TBA-354),  diamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043)
are being developed in an attempt to combat the disease. This review
presents a general introduction to the current status of the disease,
the biology of the pathogen as well as the state of drug development
against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major problems and bottlenecks
associated with the same. Starting from the first drug against TB,
the review discusses the entire history and the course of development
of the drugs which are available today in the market as well as those
which are under various phases of clinical and pre-clinical trials
along with their mechanism of  action. It also talks about the possible
role of nanosciences in combating TB.

 27275075   Anand N et al (2016) "Antimicrobial agents' utilization and cost pattern in an Intensive Care Unit of a Teaching Hospital in South India." Indian J Crit Care Med 20(5), 274-279

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High utilization and inappropriate usage of antimicrobial
agents (AMAs) in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) increases resistant organisms,
morbidity, mortality, and treatment cost. Prescription audit and active
feedback  are a proven method to check the irrational prescription.
Measuring drug utilization in DDD/100 bed-days is proposed by the WHO
to analyze and compare the utilization of drugs. Data of AMAs utilization
are required for planning an antibiotic policy and for follow-up of
intervention strategies. Hence, in this study, we proposed to evaluate
the utilization pattern and cost analysis of AMA used in the ICU. METHODOLOGY:
A prospective observational study was conducted for 1 year from January
1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, and the data were obtained from the
ICU of a tertiary care hospital. The demographic data, disease data,
relevant investigation, the utilization of different classes of AMAs
(WHO-ATC classification) as well as individual drugs and their costs
were recorded. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and sixty-two prescriptions
of AMAs were recorded during the study period with an average of 1.73
+/- 0.04 prescriptions/patient. About 80.4% patients were prescribed
AMAs during admission. Ceftriaxone (22.77%) was the most commonly prescribed
AMA followed by  piperacillin/tazobactam (15.79%), metronidazole (12%),
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (6.44%), and azithromycin (4.34%). Ceftriaxone,
piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and linezolid were the five
maximally utilized AMAs with 38.52, 19.22, 14.34, 8.76, and 8.16 DDD/100
bed-days respectively. An average cost of AMAs used per patient was
2213 Indian rupees (INR). CONCLUSION: A high utilization of AMAs and
a high cost of treatment were noticed which was comparable to other
published data, though an increased use of newer AMAs such as linezolid,
clindamycin, meropenem, colistin was noticed.

 27274980   Britt NS, Potter EM (2016) "Clinical epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant and bloodstream infections." J Glob Antimicrob Resist 5, 57-61

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of vancomycin-resistant
enterococcal bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) caused by Enterococcus
gallinarum or Enterococcus casseliflavus. Variables associated with
treatment failure were determined and treatment options were compared.
This was a national retrospective study of hospitalised Veterans Affairs
patients with non-faecium, non-faecalis VRE BSI. The primary outcome
was treatment failure, defined as a composite of: (i) 30-day all-cause
mortality; (ii) microbiological failure; and (iii) 30-day VRE BSI recurrence.
Stepwise Poisson regression was conducted to determine variables associated
with treatment failure. In total, 48 patients were included, with 29
cases (60.4%) caused by E. gallinarum and 19 cases (39.6%) caused by
E. casseliflavus. Among these cases, 20 (41.7%) were treated with an
anti-VRE agent  (linezolid or daptomycin) and 28 (58.3%) were treated
with an anti-enterococcal beta-lactam. Overall, 30-day mortality was
10.4% (5/48) and composite treatment failure was 39.6% (19/48). In
multivariate analysis, treatment with an anti-enterococcal beta-lactam
was associated with increased treatment failure in  comparison with
anti-VRE therapy (adjusted risk ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval
1.06-4.97; P = 0.031). Overall, treatment with linezolid or daptomycin
for vancomycin-resistant E. gallinarum or E. casseliflavus BSI resulted
in improved clinical outcomes in comparison with anti-enterococcal
beta-lactam treatment.

sepsis. Linezolid resistance and mucoid character together made this
pathogen difficult to treat. To our knowledge this is the first such
report.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infected pancreatic necrosis is a major complications
of acute pancreatitis. If drainage is required, local administration
of antibiotics  through transmural nasocystic or percutaneous catheter
may allow increasing local antibiotic concentrations. Drug diffusion
becomes the main factor influencing local drug tissue penetration.
The present study aims at providing the rationale  for the design of
new research protocols evaluating the efficacy of local antibiotics
for infected pancreatic necrosis. METHODS: A review of microbiological
data was performed for the most common organisms causing the infection,
antibiotics spectrum and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). A
search of the physico-chemical properties of antibiotics was performed
to calculate the diffusion coefficients. An estimation of the antibiotic
concentrations in pancreatic tissue was obtained using a mathematical
model. Efficacy factors (EF) were calculated and the stability of the
antibiotic solutions were evaluated to optimize the dosing regimen.
RESULTS: Piperacillin, vancomycin and metronidazole achieve high concentrations
in the surrounding tissue very fast. Imipenem, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin,
gentamicin, linezolid and cloxacillin achieve intermediate concentration
values. Tigecycline, showed the lowest concentration values (<2 mg/L).
Calculated EF is highest for piperacillin  and imipenem short after
administration and near to surface diffusion area (0.5 cm), but EF
of imipenem is higher at deeper areas and longer time after administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering obtained results, some solutions are proposed
using saline as diluent and 25 degrees C of temperature during administration.
Imipenem has the best theoretical results in empiric local treatment.
Linezolid and tigecycline solutions are not recommended.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common
causes of a variety of infections ranging from wound infections to
urinary tract infections (UTI) in hospital and community. In this study
during 3 years we characterized the antibiotic resistance patterns
of 491 hospital acquired MRSA and community associated MRSA strains
by the guidelines of clinical and laboratory standard institute. A
combination of high resolution PhP typing method and SCCmec typing
were used for clonal dissemination of isolates. Among all 491 MRSA
strains, diverse PhP types consisting of 29 common types (CTs) and
4 single types (STs) and also 2 different SCCmec types (III and IVa)
were detected. In addition, 18 CTs were common among CA- and HA-MRSA
strains and the presence of all 4 STs was limited to HA-MRSA strains.
All isolates were resistant to penicillin and high level resistance
was observed against ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tobramycin and kanamycin
and the rate of resistance to most of the antibiotic tested among HA-MRSA
was significantly higher than CA-MRSA isolates. Moreover, all isolates
showed susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin
and  very low resistance to fusidic acid, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol
were detected. Our findings illustrated the increasing rate of clonal
dissemination and persistence of highly antibiotic resistant CA-MRSA
strains in Tehran hospitals, and also indicated the important role
of the hospitals as the reservoir of MRSA strains.

 27262336   Gkentzi D et al (2016) "Treatment Options for Persistent Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal Bacteremia in  Neonates." Curr Pediatr Rev

BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the leading
cause of late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive-care units (NICUs).
Despite adequate therapeutic levels and in vivo susceptibility, vancomycin
is not always adequate  in clearing CoNS bacteremias and other theurapeutic
regimens are warranted especially when dealing with persistent CoNS
bacteremias. METHODS: Retrospective  analysis of neonates with persistent
CoNS bacteremias in a tertiary NICU in two study periods (January 2006
to December 2007 and January 2011 to December 2012).  Demographics,
clinical characteristics and antibiotics used were recorded. We also
performed a literature review on the treatment options for persistent
CoNS bacteremia. RESULTS: Out of the 1485 admissions during the 4 years,
121 (8,1%) neonates developed CoNS bacteremia and 42 (34.7%) were persistent.
The most common CoNS species was S.epidermidis (91%). Apart from the
shorter mean duration of bacteremia (p = 0.003), during the second
part of the study, no other differences were observed between the two
study periods. Ten (23.8%) neonates were treated with vancomycin monotherapy.
In 23 (54.7%) neonates, rifampicin was  added to vancomycin. Linezolid
was given to seven neonates (16.6%) whereas daptomycin to two (4.7%).
No differences were found when we compared the characteristics of neonates
treated with different antibiotics. All neonates tolerated treatment
well. Our literature review revealed 16 relevant studies, the majority
of which are small case series. Conlusions: The addition of rifampicin,
linezolid and daptomycin in neonates with persistent CoNS bacteremia
can provide  useful therapeutic alternatives. Further studies are required
to bring more insight in the field.

 27259840   Kaku N et al (2016) "Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects of tedizolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection." Int J Med Microbiol

Tedizolid (TZD) is a second-generation oxazolidinone and demonstrates
potent in-vitro activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive
bacteria. Phase III studies in patients with acute bacterial skin and
skin structure infections (ABSSSI) have demonstrated the non-inferiority
of TZD to linezolid (LZD). However, there are only a few studies that
show the effect of TZD in pulmonary infections. In this study, we investigated
the effect of TZD in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection
caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The mice
were treated either twice daily with saline (control), 25mg/kg of vancomycin
(low-VAN), 110mg/kg of vancomycin (high-VAN), 120mg/kg of LZD or once
daily with 20mg/kg of TZD. As compared to the control, the low- and
high-VAN treatment groups, LZD and TZD significantly improved the survival
rate,  reduced the bacterial count in the lungs. Furthermore, TZD decreased
the area of  central bacterial colony zone (CBCZ) at 36h post-inoculation,
compared with the control. In addition, we investigated the immunomodulatory
effect of TZD by evaluating the plasma concentrations of the inflammatory
cytokines. Although there were no significant differences in the bacterial
count in the lungs amongst the drugs at 26h post-inoculation, TZD and
LZD significantly improved the plasma  concentrations of TNF-alpha,
IL-6 and MIP-2, in comparison with the control. In this study, both
TZD and LZD demonstrated antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy
in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection caused by MRSA.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic
susceptibility pattern as well as the phenotypic and genotypic biofilm
formation  ability of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients
with urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: A total of 39 isolates
of S. aureus were collected from patients with UTI. The antibiotic
susceptibility patterns of the isolates were determined by the Kirby-Bauer
disk-diffusion. We used the Modified Congo red agar (MCRA) and Microtiter
plate methods to assess the ability of biofilm formation. All isolates
were examined for determination of biofilm related genes, icaA, fnbA,
clfA and bap using PCR method. RESULTS: Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin
and chloramphenicol were the most effective agents against S. aureus
isolates. Overall, 69.2% of S. aureus isolates were biofilm producers.
Resistance to four antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (71.4% vs. 28.6%,
P=0.001), tetracycline (57.7% vs. 42.3%, P=0.028), erythromycin and
ciprofloxacin (56% vs. 44%, P=0.017) was higher among biofilm producers
than non-biofilm producers. The icaA, fnbA and clfA genes were present
in all S. aureus isolates. However, bap gene was not detected in any
of the isolates. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the role of biofilm
formation in resistance to antimicrobial agents. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole
and doxycycline may be used as an effective treatment for UTI caused
by biofilm producers S. aureus. Our results suggest that biofilm formation
is not dependent to just icaA, fnbA, clfA and bap  genes harbor in
S. aureus strains.

 27247896   Ullah A et al (2016) "High frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Peshawar Region  of Pakistan." Springerplus 5, 600

Staphylococcus aureus is an increasing problem in clinical practice
because of reduced susceptibility to available antibiotics. The objective
of the study was to determine the frequency of Methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA) in Peshawar, Pakistan. Clinical isolates of S. aureus
were subjected to determination of antibiotic resistance, MICs and
inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR). Out of total 280 S. aureus
isolates, the frequency of MRSA was 36.1 % (n = 101). MRSA infection
was found higher among the age group 50-59 years (60.71 %, OR 3.09),
followed by 20-29 years (47.5 %, OR 1.74). Frequency of MRSA in female
and male was 39.8 and 34 % respectively. MRSA was more frequent in
blood specimens (48.7 %, OR 2.14). The frequency of community and hospital
acquired MRSA was 42 and 34.8 % respectively. MRSA showed high resistance
(100 %) to penicillin and cefoxitin followed by erythromycin (99 %).
While MRSA exhibited 100 % susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid.
We have also found 7 vancomycin intermediate sensitive S. aureus (VISA)
isolates. ICR was observed in 15.84 % (n  = 16) of MRSA isolates. It
is concluded that MRSA is potential threat to public health in Peshawar.
Vancomycin and linezolid could be prescribed as a drug of choice in
treating MRSA associated infections. In addition, ICR should be routinely
checked to avoid clindamycin treatment failure.

Objective. Recently, community and hospital-acquired infections with
Staphylococcus aureus have increased and raised antibiotic resistant
isolates. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antibiotic resistance
profile of S. aureus isolates over several years in various clinical
specimens from our hospital. Materials and Methods. S. aureus strains
from 2009 to 2014 were isolated from various clinical samples at Yuzuncu
Yil University, Dursun Odabas Medical Center, Microbiology Laboratory,
and their antibiotic susceptibility test results were retrospectively
investigated. The isolates were identified by conventional methods,
and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by the Phoenix (Becton
Dickinson, USA) automated system method according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. Results. A total of 1,116 S.
aureus isolates were produced and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
to 21% of all S. aureus isolates between 2009 and 2014. According to
the results of susceptibility tests of all isolates of S. aureus, they
have been identified as sensitive to vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid,
and levofloxacin. While the resistance rates to nitrofurantoin, quinupristin-dalfopristin,
and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were determined as 0.3%, 2.4%, and
6%, respectively, resistance rates to penicillin, erythromycin, rifampicin,
gentamicin, and clindamycin were determined as 100%, 18%, 14%, 14%,
and 11%, respectively. The highest percentage of methicillin resistance
was determined as  30% in 2009, and the resistance was determined to
have decreased in subsequent years (20%, 16%, 13%, 19%, and 21%) (p
< 0.001). Conclusion. Currently, retrospective evaluations of causes
of nosocomial infection should be done periodically. We think that
any alteration of resistance over the years has to be identified, and
all centers must determine their own resistance profiles, in order
to guide empirical therapies. Reducing the rate of antibiotic resistance
will contribute to reducing the cost of treatment.

 27246230   Garcia-Martinez L et al (2016) "Impact of the PROVAUR stewardship programme on linezolid resistance in a tertiary university hospital: a before-and-after interventional study." J Antimicrob Chemother

BACKGROUND: There is little evidence of the impact of antimicrobial
stewardship programmes on antimicrobial resistance. OBJECTIVES: To
study the efficacy and safety of a package of educational and interventional
measures to optimize linezolid use and its impact on bacterial resistance.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was designed and carried out before
and after implementation of a stewardship programme in hospitalized
patients with Gram-positive infections treated with linezolid. RESULTS:
The intervention reduced linezolid consumption by 76%. The risk of
linezolid-resistant CoNS isolates (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.27-0.49; P
< 0.001) and Enterococcus faecalis (OR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.21-0.90;
P = 0.03) during the intervention period was lower than in the pre-intervention
period. CONCLUSIONS: A programme to optimize linezolid use can contribute
to reducing the resistance rate of CoNS and E. faecalis to this antibiotic.

BACKGROUND: During 2013, the haematology/oncology unit at a tertiary
level paediatric hospital in South Africa experienced the emergence
of infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). OBJECTIVE:
To describe the clinical and  molecular aspects of the cases identified.
METHODS: VRE isolates identified from  blood culture specimens processed
at the National Health Laboratory Service were  screened for the presence
of the vancomycin resistance genes vanA, B and C1, 2 and 3. Further
characterisation of these isolates was carried out using pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PGFE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Clinical
records of infected patients were reviewed to identify possible risk
factors, while surveillance with rectal swabs was performed to identify
VRE-colonised patients. RESULTS: Four patients with haematological
malignancies were identified with VRE bloodstream infections. Patients
were immunocompromised  at the time of the bloodstream infection (BSI),
with receipt of vancomycin prior  to VRE-BSI, and infections were treated
with linezolid. Colonisation with VRE was found in 8 of 55 patients
screened. Infected and colonised patients were isolated in the unit
during their admission and strict contact precaution infection control
practices were instituted. The vanA gene was identified in all of the
isolates but one. PFGE and MLST results showed a degree of genetic
relatedness between certain isolates obtained from rectal swab and
blood culture samples, suggesting possible patient-to-patient transmission
or persistence of the isolates in the unit. CONCLUSION: Strict infection
control practices are necessary to prevent infection and transmission
of resistant organisms among vulnerable patients.

 27241651   Ghosh S, Banerjee M (2016) "Methicillin resistance & inducible clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus." Indian J Med Res 143(3), 362-364

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) isolates with inducible clindamycin resistance (iCR) are resistant
to erythromycin and sensitive to clindamycin on routine testing and
inducible clindamycin resistance can only be identified by D-test.
This study was aimed to  detect methicillin resistance and iCR among
S. aureus isolates, effectiveness of  some commonly used antibiotics
and correlation between methicillin resistance and iCR. METHODS: The
present cross-sectional study included 46 S. aureus isolates subjected
to Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility
testing (AST) to estimate MRSA and resistance to some commonly used
antibiotics.  D-test was employed to detect iCR. RESULTS: Eleven of
the 46 (23.9%) isolates tested were MRSA. Overall, 19 (41.3%) isolates
showed of iCR. Vancomycin and linezolid were found to be 100 per cent
effective. A positive Karl-Pearson's coefficient of correlation (0.89)
between methicillin resistance and iCR was obtained. INTERPRETATION
& CONCLUSIONS: Detection of iCR is important for the use of clindamycin
in MRSA infections. Methicillin resistance and iCR appear to be clinically
unrelated.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have
become one of the most challenging nosocomial pathogens with the rapid
spread of the multi-drug resistant strain with limited therapeutic
options. It is a matter of concern due to its ability to transfer vancomycin
resistant gene to other organisms. The present study was undertaken
to determine the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and
the vanA gene among the isolates in a tertiary care hospital of North-East
India. METHODS: A total of 67 consecutive enterococcal isolates from
different clinical samples were collected and identified by using the
standard methods. Antibiogram was done by disk diffusion  method and
VRE was screened by the disk diffusion and vancomycin supplement agar
dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for
vancomycin  was determined by E-test. The VRE isolates were analyzed
by PCR for vanA gene. RESULTS: A total of 54 (81%) Enterococcus faecalis
and 13 (19%) E. faecium were detected among the clinical isolates and
16 (24%) were VRE. The VRE isolates were multidrug resistant and linezolid
resistance was also found to be in three. MIC range to vancomycin was
16-32 microg/ml among the VRE. The vanA gene was found in nine of 16
VRE isolates. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of VRE and presence
of vanA in a tertiary care hospital setting in North-East India indicate
toward a need for implementing infection control policies and active
surveillance.

 27234592   Le J et al (2016) "Effects of vancomycin versus nafcillin in enhancing killing of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus causing bacteremia by human cathelicidin LL-37." Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis

Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam
antibiotics, like nafcillin, render methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) more susceptible to killing by innate host defense peptides
(HDPs), such as cathelicidin LL-37. We compared the effects of growth
in 1/4 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nafcillin or vancomycin
on the LL-37 killing of 92 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)
isolates. For three randomly selected strains among these, we examined
the effects of nafcillin, vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid on LL-37
killing and autolysis. Growth in the presence of subinhibitory nafcillin
significantly enhanced LL-37 killing of MSSA compared  to vancomycin
and antibiotic-free controls. Nafcillin also reduced MSSA production
of the golden staphylococcal pigment staphyloxanthin in 39 % of pigmented
strains vs. 14 % for vancomycin. Among the antibiotics tested, only
nafcillin resulted in significantly increased MSSA autolysis. These
studies point to additional mechanisms of anti-staphylococcal activity
of nafcillin beyond direct bactericidal activity, properties that vancomycin
and other antibiotic classes do not exhibit. The ability of nafcillin
to enhance sensitivity to innate HDPs may contribute to its superior
effectiveness against MSSA, as suggested by studies comparing clinical
outcomes to vancomycin treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) is a common pathogen worldwide and its multidrug resistance
is a major concern. This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics
and antibiotic susceptibility profile of healthcare-associated MRSA
with emphasis on  resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin
B (MLSB) phenotypes and vancomycin. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
was carried out between February  2014 and February 2015 across four
tertiary care hospitals in Mangalore, South India. Healthcare-associated
infections among 291 inpatients at these hospitals were identified
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.
Clinical specimens were collected based on infection type. S. aureus
and MRSA isolates were identified and antibiotic susceptibility tests
performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The minimum
inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was determined using the Agar
dilution method and inducible clindamycin resistance was detected with
a double-disk diffusion test (D-test). RESULTS: Out of 291 healthcare-associated
S. aureus cases, 88 were MRSA (30.2%).  Of these, 54.6% were skin and
soft tissue infections. All of the isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin
and linezolid. Four MRSA isolates exhibited intermediate resistance
to vancomycin (4.6%). Of the MRSA strains, 10 (11.4%) were constitutive
MLSB phenotypes, 31 (35.2%) were inducible MLSB phenotypes and  14
(15.9%) were macrolide-streptogramin B phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Healthcare-associated
MRSA multidrug resistance was alarmingly high. In routine antibiotic
susceptibility testing, a D-test should always be performed if an isolate
is resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to clindamycin. Determination
of the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin is necessary
when treating patients with MRSA infections.

 27226873   Zarei Koosha R et al (2016) "Distribution of tsst-1 and mecA Genes in Staphylococcus aureus Isolated From Clinical Specimens." Jundishapur J Microbiol 9(3), e29057

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a harmful pathogen known to express
numerous virulence factors and cause severe infections. High levels
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are one
of the important healthcare problems because of the inefficient treatment
of these infections. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study is
to evaluate the incidence of the toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst-1)
gene and its association with the prevalence of the mecA gene and drug
resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The presence of the tsst-1 and
mecA genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among
S. aureus isolated from 197 clinical samples. In addition, resistance
tests to 12 antibiotics were carried out by the disc diffusion method.
RESULTS: Among the 197 isolates, 134 (68%) contained the tsst-1 genes
and 172 (87.3%) contained the mecA genes. The prevalence of both genes
was higher among male cases and samples purified from wounds and blood.
We found no significant correlation between the presences of the two
mentioned genes within isolates. The highest resistance we observed
among our samples was to penicillin. None of isolates was resistant
to vancomycin or linezolid. A significant correlation was  observed
between the presence of the mecA gene and resistance to oxacillin,
gentamicin, kanamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, clindamycin,
cephazolin and the multi-drug resistant property, which is resistance
to more than three antibiotics (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our outcomes
showed elevated incidences of tsst-1 positive and MRSA strains with
higher rates of antibiotic resistance. The conflict between our findings
and other records may be due to differences in geographic regions.

 27217714   Collins DW et al (2016) "Association of primary open-angle glaucoma with mitochondrial variants and haplogroups common in African Americans." Mol Vis 22, 454-471

PURPOSE: To estimate the population frequencies of all common mitochondrial
variants and ancestral haplogroups among 1,999 subjects recruited for
the Primary Open-Angle African American Glaucoma Genetics (POAAGG)
Study, including 1,217 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) cases and
782 controls, and to identify ancestral subpopulations and mitochondrial
mutations as potential risk factors for POAG susceptibility. METHODS:
Subject classification by characteristic glaucomatous optic nerve findings
and corresponding visual field defects, as defined by enrolling glaucoma
specialists, stereo disc photography, phlebotomy, extraction of total
DNA from peripheral blood or saliva, DNA quantification and normalization,
PCR amplification of whole mitochondrial genomes, Ion Torrent deep
semiconductor DNA sequencing on DNA pools ("Pool-seq"), Sanger sequencing
of 3,479 individual mitochondrial DNAs, and bioinformatic analysis.
RESULTS: The distribution of common African haplogroups within the
POAAGG study population was broadly similar to prior surveys of African
Americans. However, the POAG case population was found to be enriched
in L1c2 haplogroups, which are defined in part by missense mutations
m.6150G>A (Val83Ile, odds ratio [OR] 1.8, p=0.01), m.6253C>T (Met117Thr,
rs200165736, OR 1.6, p=0.04), and m.6480G>A (Val193Ile, rs199476128,
OR 4.6, p=0.04) in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (MT-CO1) gene
and by a variant, m.2220A>G (OR 2.0, p=0.01), in MT-RNR2, which encodes
the mitochondrial ribosomal 16s RNA gene. L2 haplogroups were predicted
to be overrepresented in the POAG case population by Pool-seq, and
the difference was confirmed to be significant with Sanger sequencing,
that targeted the L2-associated variants m.2416T>C (rs28358580, OR
1.2, p=0.02) and m.2332C>T (OR 1.2, p=.02) in MT-RNR2. Another variant
within MT-RNR2, m.3010G>A (rs3928306), previously implicated in sensitivity
to the optic neuropathy-associated antibiotic linezolid, and arising
on D4 and J1 lineages, associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
(LHON) severity, was confirmed to be common (>5%) but was not significantly
enriched in the POAG cases. Two variants linked to the composition
of the gut microbiome, m.15784T>C (rs527236194, haplogroup L2a1) and
m.16390G>A (rs41378955, L2 haplogroups), were also enriched in the
case DNA pools. CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate African mtDNA
haplogroups L1c2, L1c2b, and L2 as risk factors for POAG. Approximately
one in four African Americans have these mitochondrial ancestries,
which may contribute to their elevated glaucoma risk. These haplogroups
are defined in part by ancestral variants in the MT-RNR2 and/or MT-CO1
genes, several of which have prior disease  associations, such as MT-CO1
missense variants that have been implicated in prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: European centers (n = 226) involved in the Tigecycline
Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST, 2004-2014) submitted data
and bacterial isolates. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations
and susceptibility were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute methods and European Committee  on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing breakpoints. RESULTS: The rates of the following resistant
pathogens increased from 2004 to 2014: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-positive Escherichia coli (from 8.9 to 16.9%), multidrug-resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii complex (from 15.4 to 48.5%), and ESBL-positive
Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 17.2 to 23.7%). The rate of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus was 27.5% in 2004 and 28.9% in 2014.  Resistance
to the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) was 37.4 and 14.5% for
A.  baumannii complex and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Carbapenem
resistance was </=4.3% among the Enterobacteriaceae and 0.2% against
Streptococcus pneumoniae. The resistance to tigecycline ranged between
7.4% against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and 0.0% against S. aureus.
CONCLUSIONS: The carbapenems and tigecycline were active against Enterobacteriaceae.
Agents with activity against A. baumannii complex and P. aeruginosa
are limited. The carbapenems, tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin
were active against Gram-positive organisms.

both the drugs via different mechanisms. Drugs have shown significant
contribution in inducing anemia via hemolysis and bone marrow suppression
in an infective endocarditis patient.

The in vitro activity of dalbavancin was evaluated against 9303 Staphylococcus
aureus and 2670 streptococci, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates,
collected from hospitalised patients in Europe and surrounding regions
from 2011  to 2013. Dalbavancin recently received approval for the
treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency. Bacterial identification  was confirmed by standard microbiological
methods (including MALDI-TOF), and susceptibility testing was performed
by reference broth microdilution methods. Dalbavancin susceptibility
interpretations followed FDA/EUCAST criteria. Meticillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA) and streptococci exhibiting resistance to at least
three other drug classes were considered as MDR. Dalbavancin was highly
active (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.06 mg/L; >/=99.9% susceptible) against MDR
and non-MDR MRSA isolates. Vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid were
also active (99.6-100.0% susceptible) against MDR MRSA, however MIC90
values for these drugs were 8- to 16-fold higher than dalbavancin (MIC90
values of 1, 0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively). All viridans group streptococci
(VGS) and beta-haemolytic streptococci were susceptible to dalbavancin
regardless of resistance phenotype (MIC50/90 values of </=0.03 mg/L
and 0.06 mg/L, respectively). Dalbavancin MIC50/90 results (MIC50/90,
</=0.03/0.06 mg/L) against MDR VGS were at least eight-fold lower than
those of vancomycin (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L), daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.5/1
mg/L) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L). Overall, dalbavancin exhibited
potent in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus and streptococci,
including MDR phenotypes. Dalbavancin had the lowest MIC50/90 results
against the isolates tested, relative to comparator agents, regardless
of resistance phenotypes.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of distribution and drug
resistance of  bacterial infection in several different parts of hematology
department inpatients of Anhui Provincial Hospital from January 2010
to December 2014, including patients who had received hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Anti-microbial susceptibility
test was done by Kirby-Bauer method and automated systems and the data
were analysed by WHONET 5.6 software. RESULTS: A total of 3 312 copies
of inspection samples were analyzed, including 2 716 (82%) blood samples
and other 596 specimens (18%). 634 bacterial strains were isolated
from 3 312 samples (19.14%) including 488 samples (76.97%) from blood
culture. 427 (67.35%) bacterial strains were gram-negative, and the
other 207 (32.65%) were gram-positive. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most common gram-negative
bacterial and the resistant rates to imipenem were 0.8%, 11.8% and
3.3%, respectively. Detection rates of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases
in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 83.9% and 75.0%,
respectively. At the same time, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus were most common kinds of gram-positive
bacteria. Methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus accounted
for 65.9% antibiotic resistance. No vancomycin and/or linezolid and/or
tigecycline resistant strains of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus
spp. were found in those patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with hematology
diseases had a higher risk of bacterial infections, mainly caused by
Gram-negative bacteria. There are different distributions of bacterial
in different wards.

 27208687   Tong MC, Wisniewski CS, Wolf B, Bosso JA (2016) "Comparison of Linezolid and Vancomycin for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia: Institutional Implications." Pharmacotherapy

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggesting clinical superiority of linezolid
over vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) pneumonia led to a change in our institution's clinical
pathway/order form for hospital-acquired pneumonia, positioning linezolid
as the preferred agent. Our objective was to assess the impact of this
change within our institution. DESIGN: Retrospective electronic medical
records review. METHODS: The analysis for this observational study
included eligible patients admitted to our medical center between May
1, 2011 and August 31, 2014, with ICD-9 codes for MRSA and pneumonia.
Included patients were at least 18 years of age and had vancomycin
or linezolid initiated at least 2 days after admission and continued
for at least 2 consecutive days. The primary endpoints were extent
of antibiotic use before and  after order form change and length of
stay (LOS) and hospital charges in the two  treatment groups. A secondary
aim was to detect any gross discrepancies in patient outcomes such
as treatment duration, mechanical ventilation duration, all-cause mortality
rate, nephrotoxicity, and 30-day readmission between the two  treatment
groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes in 227 patients were
assessed. Linezolid use increased 16.2% subsequent to the change in
the order form. Although not statistically significant, the median
hospital admission charge was $6,200 lower in patients treated with
linezolid compared with those treated with vancomycin ($25,900 vs.
$32,100). Hospital LOS was significantly associated with Charlson comorbidity
index (P < 0.001), the type of treatment (p  = 0.032), duration of
treatment (p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001),  and ICU
admission (p < 0.001). All-cause mortality favored linezolid treatment
and these patients were more likely to be discharged (shorter LOS).
CONCLUSIONS:  Although linezolid use increased markedly with this pathway/order
form change, no negative institutional consequences or unfavorable
patient outcomes were detected, justifying the change in policy from
these perspectives. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

BACKGROUND: The antibibiotic resistance by nosocomial infections (NI)
causal agents constitutes a seriously global problematic that involves
the Mexican Institute of Social Security's Regional General Hospital
1 in Chihuahua, Mexico;  although with special features that required
to be specified and evaluated, in order to concrete an effective therapy.
METHODS: Observational, descriptive and prospective study; by means
of active vigilance all along 2014 in order to detect the nosocomial
infections, for epidemiologic study, culture and antibiogram to identify
its causal agents and antibiotics resistance and sensitivity. RESULTS:
Among 13527 hospital discharges, 1079 displayed NI (8 %), standed out:
the related on vascular lines, of surgical site, pneumonia and urinal
track; they added up two thirds of the total. We carried out culture
and antibiogram about 300 of them (27.8 %); identifying 31 bacterian
species, mainly seven of those (77.9 %): Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus and epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae; showing multiresistance
to 34 tested antibiotics, except in seven with low or without resistance
at all: vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin,
piperacilin-tazobactam, amikacin and carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: When
we contrasted those results with the recommendations in the clinical
practice guides, it aroused several contradictions; so they must be
taken with reserves and has to be tested in each hospital, by means
of cultures and antibiograms in practically every case of nosocomial
infection.

OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug sensitivity test of bacteria
of patients on chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps.
METHOD: The purulent discharges were collected from sinus of 175 patients
with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps during endoscopic
sinus surgery. The  results of germiculture and drug sensitivity test
were analyzed. RESULT: From 175 specimens, 118 (67%) showed positive
results in germiculture. Among them, 79 strains of gram positive bacteria
and 39 strains of gram negative bacteria were detected. Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus haemolyticus
were the most common pathogens in gram positive bacteria. The most
common pathogens of gram negative bacteria were P. Aeruginosa, Enterobacter
aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae. The sensitive antibiotic on gram positive
bacteria were amikacin, Daptomycin, Linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin,
amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, cefuroxime, respectively. The
sensitive antibiotics on Gram negative bacteria were amikacin, Cefoperazone/sulbactam
and imipenem, ceftazidime ceftazidime, aztreonam, levofloxacin, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection was common happened in the sinus cavity
of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps.
Gram positive  bacteria were the main pathogenic bacteria and gram
positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria have great differences
in the sensitivity of antibiotics. For patients with chronic rhinosinusitis,
the using of antibiotics should depend on the drug sensitivity test.

We investigated the prognostic role of high MICs for antistaphylococcal
agents in patients with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
catheter-related bloodstream infection (MSSA CRBSI). We prospectively
reviewed 83 episodes from 5  centers in Spain during April 2011-June
2014 that had optimized clinical management and analyzed the relationship
between E-test MICs for vancomycin, daptomycin, oxacillin, and linezolid
and development of complicated bacteremia by using multivariate analysis.
Complicated MSSA CRBSI occurred in 26 (31.3%) patients; MICs for vancomycin
and daptomycin were higher in these patients (optimal cutoff values
for predictive accuracy = 1.5 mug/mL and 0.5 mug/mL). High MICs for
vancomycin (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.5) and daptomycin (hazard
ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.9) were independent risk factors for development
of complicated MSSA CRBSI. Our data suggest that patients with MSSA
CRBSI caused by  strains that have high MICs for vancomycin or daptomycin
are at increased risk for complications.

Kocuria species were placed previously under the genus Micrococcus,
are skin and  oropharynx commensals in mammals, including man. A rare
bacteria, Kocuria kristinae isolated from a new born with umbilical
sepsis. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility was done by Vitek
2 compact system (Biomerieux). The isolate was sensitive to higher
antibiotics like vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. As this new
pathogen resembles coagulase negative staphylococcus, it should not
be misidentified.

Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA)
have globally emerged in animal husbandry. In addition to methicillin
resistance, LA-MRSA may carry a variety of novel and uncommon antimicrobial
resistance genes. Occurrence of the same resistance genes in coagulase-negative
staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus suggests an ongoing genetic exchange
between LA-MRSA and other staphylococci whose driving forces in the
ecological niche of the farm environment are, however, still poorly
understood. To assess the potential of CoNS as putative reservoirs
for antibiotic resistance genes, we analysed the antimicrobial susceptibility
of CoNS from dust and manure samples obtained in 41  pig farms in Germany,
most of them (36 of 41) with a proven LA-MRSA/MSSA history. Among the
344 isolates analysed, 18 different CoNS species were identified and
S. sciuri represented the most prevalent species (46%). High resistance
rates were detected for tetracycline (71%), penicillin (65%) and oxacillin
(64%) as well as  fusidic acid (50%), which was mainly due to reduced
susceptibility among S. sciuri isolates. S. sciuri exhibited pronounced
multiresistance, and many isolates were characterised by the carriage
of a number of uncommon (multi)resistance genes (e.g. cfr, apmA, fexA)
and decreased susceptibility towards last resort antibiotics such as
linezolid and daptomycin. The combined data suggest that S. sciuri
harbours a significant resistance gene pool that requires further attention.
We hypothesise that members of this species, due to their flexible
lifestyle, might contribute to the spread of such genes in livestock
environments.

BACKGROUND: We previously reported the case of a 64-year-old man with
mediastinitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in which the infecting
bacterium acquired linezolid resistance after only 14 days treatment
with linezolid. We therefore investigated relevant clinical isolates
for possible mechanisms of this rapid acquisition of linezolid resistance.
METHODS: Using clinical S. aureus isolates, we assessed the in vitro
mutation rate and performed stepwise selection for linezolid resistance.
To investigate homologous recombination, sequences were determined
for each of the 23S ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA) loci; analyzed sequences
spanned the entirety of each 23S rRNA gene, including domain V, as
well as the 16S-23S intergenic spacer regions. We additionally performed
next-generation sequencing on clinical strains to identify single-nucleotide
polymorphisms compared to the N315 genome. RESULTS: Strains isolated
from the patient prior to  linezolid exposure (M5-M7) showed higher-level
linezolid resistance than N315, and the pre-exposure strain (M2) exhibited
more rapid acquisition of linezolid resistance than did N315. However,
the mutation rates of these and contemporaneous clinical isolates were
similar to those of N315, and the isolates did not exhibit any mutations
in hypermutation-related genes. Sequences of the 23S rRNA genes and
16S-23S intergenic spacer regions were identical among the pre- and
post-exposure clinical strains. Notably, all of the pre-exposure isolates
harbored a recQ missense mutation (Glu69Asp) with respect to N315;
such  a lesion may have affected short sequence recombination (facilitating,
for example, recombination among rrn loci). We hypothesize that this
mechanism contributed to rapid acquisition of linezolid resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypermutation and homologous recombination of the ribosomal
RNA genes, including  23S rRNA genes, appear not to have been sources
of the accelerated acquisition of linezolid resistance observed in
our clinical case. Increased frequency of short  sequence recombination
may have resulted from a recQ variant in the infecting organism.

 27180242   Rodriguez-Pardo D et al (2016) "Effectiveness of sequential intravenous-to-oral antibiotic switch therapy in hospitalized patients with gram-positive infection: the SEQUENCE cohort study." Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis

Switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy may improve inpatient
management and reduce hospital stays and the complications of intravenous
treatment. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of intravenous-to-oral
antibiotic switch therapy and an early discharge algorithm in hospitalized
patients with gram-positive infection. We performed a prospective cohort
study with a retrospective comparison cohort, recruited from eight
tertiary, acute-care Spanish referral hospitals. All patients included
had culture-confirmed methicillin-resistant gram-positive infection,
or methicillin-susceptible gram-positive infection and beta-lactam
allergy and had received intravenous treatment with glycopeptides,
lipopeptides, or linezolid. The study comprised two cohorts: the prospective
cohort to assess the effectiveness of a sequential intravenous-to-oral
antibiotic switch algorithm and early discharge, and a retrospective
cohort in which the algorithm had not been applied, used as the comparator.
A total of 247 evaluable patients were included; 115 in the prospective
and 132 in the retrospective cohort. Forty-five retrospective patients
(34 %) were not changed to oral antibiotics, and 87 (66 %) were changed
to oral antibiotics without following the proposed algorithm. The duration
of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the prospective cohort
compared to the retrospective group that did not switch to oral drugs
(16.7 +/- 18.7 vs 23 +/- 13.4 days, P < 0.001). No differences were
observed regarding the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia (4.4
% vs 2.6 %, P = 0.621). Our results suggest  that an intravenous-to-oral
antibiotic switch strategy is effective for reducing  the length of
hospital stay in selected hospitalized patients with gram-positive
infection.

We surveyed the rate of M protein that was encoded by emm and emmL
[emm (-like)]  genes in group C and group G beta-hemolytic streptococci
(GCS/GGS), as well as the rate of antimicrobial susceptibility. A total
of 97 isolates [GCS/GGS (79) and other groups (18)] were tested for
M protein gene by polymerase chain reaction. Focusing on invasive infections
with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS), GCS, and GGS (isolated
from blood), M protein gene was found  in 90%, 84.6% and 78.3%, respectively.
DNA sequencing in hypervariable N terminal region of emm gene was performed
in 62 isolates. The results found 26 types of emm gene which emm222.2
may be endemic in Thailand. Antimicrobial susceptibility  results in
groups C, G and non-groups A to G indicated that penicillin, cefotaxime,
chloramphenical, clindamycin, erythromycin, linezolid, ofloxacin, and
vancomycin had high susceptibility (range 82-100%) whereas tetracycline
had low susceptibility (range 0%-15.6%).

The FDA guidance published in 2013 provided requirements for conducting
ABSSSI trials. In 2014, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and tedizolid were
introduced into the market after phase III noninferiority clinical
trials against vancomycin (for the lipoglycopeptides) and linezolid
(for tedizolid), demonstrating clinical efficacy for the treatment
of ABSSSI. Great interest exists for these agents because of the postulated
financial impact. Due to favorable pharmacokinetics which allow for
less frequent medication administration and shorter treatment durations,
these agents may prove to reduce hospital admissions and length of
stay.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find out the clinical correlation
between the presence of vancomycin-resistant genes (van A and van B)
and their expression as detected by phenotypic tests in colonized patients
and in clinical  isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enterococci were
isolated from various clinical  samples and also from fecal specimens
of colonized patients at the time of admission, after 48 h and after
5 days of admission. Identification to species level was done using
standard methods. Vancomycin susceptibility in Enterococci was detected
by disc diffusion test. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined
by agar dilution method. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to detect the presence of van genes. RESULTS: Out of all the
clinical and fecal samples processed, 12.0% isolates were either vancomycin
resistant or vancomycin intermediate. Further, these isolates carried
van A or van B genes as  confirmed by PCR methods. Expression of van
A gene was found to be more in Enterococcus faecalis (28.3%) as compared
to Enterococcus faecium (25.0%) in both clinical and fecal isolates.
16.6% strains of E. faecium and 15.0% strains each of E. faecalis and
Enterococcus gallinarum were found to carry van B genes. The overall
prevalence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) in colonized patients
was about 9.6%. Prior administration of antibiotics had significant
effect (P = 0.001) on VRE carriage. Urinary tract infection was the
most common infection caused by vancomycin susceptible Enterococci
(VSE), 105/214 (49.0%) and VRE, 13/36 (36.1%). There was no significant
difference (P = 0.112) in the distribution of VRE and VSE in different
infection types. Both clinical and fecal VRE showed maximum resistance
to penicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. Resistance to linezolid
was 2.8% in clinically isolated VRE. CONCLUSION: VRE in our study were
found to be resistant to a number of commonly used antibiotics. The
frequency of isolation of vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE.fs),
which is highly virulent, and the number of strains harboring van A
gene in our hospital setup is high and needs to be addressed.

Enterococci have a widespread attendance in the circumference and belongs
to the  enteric commensal microbiota. Most of them produce the antimicrobial
compounds and have an inhibition effect on pathogenic microorganisms.
The objective of this study was to characterize the enterococcal strains
isolated from human normal flora and assess their antibacterial activity.
Enterococcal isolates were obtained from the feces of eighteen healthy
humans. All enterococcal species were identified by biochemical and
species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These isolates were
investigated further to examine their ability to inhibit growth of
Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli by well diffusion
assay. Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility test was performed and
genetic relatedness of all isolates was evaluated by Pulse Field Gel
Electrophoresis (PFGE). In all, 432 isolates were obtained from fecal
samples. All of the isolates identified as Enterococcus faecium by
biochemical and molecular (PCR) methods. Using repetitive element palindromic
(REP)-PCR method 54 patterns have been obtained and were selected for
further evaluation. The results indicated that 66%, 38% and 24% of
our isolates had antimicrobial effect against  S. typhi, S flexneri
and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), respectively. On the
other hand, there was no significant inhibition effect against enteropathogenic
E. coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). All isolates  were
sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, ampicillin, chloramphenicol
and gentamicin. On the other hand, the resistance rates for erythromycin,
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were 20%, 22%, and 1.8% respectively.
In addition, the analysis of PFGE showed forty patterns with eight
(40.7%) common types (CT) and thirty two (59.2%) single types (ST).
Among eight common types, only one common type (CT5) had similar antimicrobial
effect. These results suggested that  enterococcal isolates obtained
from human normal flora have potential antibacterial effect against
S. typhi, S. flexneri and E. coli.

BACKGROUND: Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) and its clinical features remain incompletely understood,
complicating empirical selection of antibiotics. METHODS: Using a multicenter,
prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP, we
calculated the prevalence  of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) among all CAP episodes.
We compared the epidemiologic, radiographic, and clinical characteristics
of S. aureus CAP (per respiratory or blood culture) with those of pneumococcal
(per respiratory or blood culture or urine antigen) and all-cause non-S.
aureus CAP using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 2259 adults
hospitalized for CAP, 37 (1.6%) had S. aureus identified, including
15 (0.7%) with MRSA and 22 (1.0%) with MSSA; 115 (5.1%) had Streptococcus
pneumoniae Vancomycin or linezolid was administered to 674 (29.8%)
patients within the first 3 days of hospitalization. Chronic hemodialysis
use was more common among patients with MRSA (20.0%) than pneumococcal
(2.6%) and all-cause non-S. aureus (3.7%) CAP. Otherwise, clinical
features at admission were similar, including concurrent influenza
infection, hemoptysis, multilobar infiltrates, and prehospital antibiotics.
Patients with MRSA CAP had more severe clinical outcomes than those
with pneumococcal CAP, including intensive care unit admission (86.7%
vs 34.8%) and in-patient mortality (13.3% vs 4.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite
very low prevalence of S. aureus and, specifically, MRSA, nearly one-third
of adults hospitalized with CAP received anti-MRSA antibiotics. The
clinical presentation of MRSA CAP overlapped substantially with pneumococcal
CAP, highlighting the challenge of accurately targeting empirical anti-MRSA
antibiotics with currently  available clinical tools and the need for
new diagnostic strategies.

Combination therapy of bacterial infections with synergistic drug partners
offers distinct advantages over monotherapy. Among these advantages
are (i) a reduction  of the drug dose required for efficacy, (ii) a
reduced potential for drug-induced toxicity, and (iii) a reduced potential
for the emergence of resistance. Here, we describe the synergistic
actions of the third-generation oral cephalosporin, cefdinir, and TXA709,
a second-generation, FtsZ-targeting prodrug that we have developed
with improved pharmacokinetics and enhanced in vivo efficacy against
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) relative to first-generation
agents. We show that the active product of TXA709 (TXA707) acts synergistically
with cefdinir in vitro against clinical isolates of MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate
S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and linezolid-resistant
S. aureus (LRSA). In addition, the combination of TXA707 and cefdinir
significantly reduces or eliminates the detectable emergence of resistance
relative to TXA707 alone. We also demonstrate synergy in vivo with
oral administration of the prodrug TXA709 and cefdinir in mouse models
of both systemic and tissue (thigh) infection with MRSA. This synergy
reduces the dose of TXA709 required for efficacy by 3-fold. Viewed
as a whole, our results highlight  the potential of TXA709 and cefdinir
as a promising combination for the treatment of drug-resistant staphylococcal
infections.

The preparation of beta-cyclodextrin-conjugated cadmium selenide-silica
nanoparticles, the loading of two drugs viz., Atorvastatin and linezolid
in the cyclodextrin cavity, and the fluorescence energy transfer between
CdSe/SiO2 nanoparticles and the drugs encapsulated in the cyclodextrin
cavity are reported  in this paper. IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry,
transmission electron microscopy, and particle size analysis by light-scattering
experiment were used as the tools of characterizing the size and the
crystal system of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles fall under hexagonal
system. The silica-shell containing CdSe nanoparticles were functionalized
by reaction with aminoethylamino-beta-cyclodextrin. Fluorescence spectra
of the nanoparticles in their free and drug-encapsulated forms were
studied. The FOrster distances between the encapsulated drugs and the
CdSe nanoparticles are below 3nm. The change in the FOrster resonance
energy parameters under physiological conditions  may aid in tracking
the release of drugs from the cavity of the cyclodextrin.

AIM: The major concern of linezolid is the adverse events. High linezolid
trough  serum concentration (Cmin) has been associated with toxicity.
The aim of this study was to analyze factors associated with high Cmin.
METHODS: Main clinical characteristics of 104 patients treated with
600 mg/12 hours of linezolid were retrospectively reviewed. Samples
were obtained just before the next dose after at least three doses
and within the first 8 days of treatment. High Cmin was considered
when it was >8 mg/L. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.
RESULTS: 34.6% patients had a Cmin >8 mg/L, and they were older and
had more frequently an estimated glomerular filtration by MDRD <40
mL/min. There  were more patients co-treated with rifampin in the group
with low Cmin. The only  factor independently associated with Cmin
>8 was the renal function. Patients with an eGF < 40 mL/min had significantly
higher Cmin than those with eGF > 80 mL/min (OR: 4.273) and there was
a trend towards a high Cmin in patients with eGF between 40-80 mL/min
(OR: 2.109). CONCLUSIONS: High Cmin were frequent, especially in patients
with MDRD <40 mL/min. Therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful to
avoid toxicity in patients with renal dysfunction.

 27156242   Lee SC et al (2016) "Identification of subclinical transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus within an intensive care unit in Taiwan." J Microbiol Immunol Infect

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Colonization, infection, and clonal dissemination
of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) have been reported in the
literature. We  aimed to investigate the incidence rate of VRE acquisition
and route of transmission of VRE within the medical intensive care
unit (ICU) to prove whether subclinical transmission occurs in medical
ICUs. METHODS: Between March 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013, rectal
cultures were obtained from all inpatients on admission and after admission
to medical ICU. Strain types of VRE were determined by both multilocus
sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: A total
of 66 of the 405 rectal swab surveillance cultures obtained from 46
inpatients were positive for VRE, among which 27 inpatients were culture-positive
for VRE on admission to medical ICU, and 19 inpatients were initially
culture-negative but converted to culture-positive after admission.
All isolates  carried vanA gene consisting of 51 Enterococcusgallinarum,
13 Enterococcus faecium, and two Eenterococcus casseliflavus. Of the
51 E. gallinarum isolates, 40 were type ST 341, seven were ST 252,
two were ST 78, and two were ST 64. The Enterococcus spp., MLST and
PFGE subtypes were almost similar among these two groups of inpatients.
Linezolid and tigecycline were most active against VRE in vitro. CONCLUSION:
Subclinical VRE cross transmission may occur in ICU. Active surveillance
and maximal barrier precautions of VRE are required at ICU with high
colonization rate of VRE and shall be beneficial.
