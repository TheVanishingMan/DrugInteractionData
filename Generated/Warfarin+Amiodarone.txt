OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a warfarin-dosing algorithm method
which can be used to guide the adjustment of warfarin maintenance dose
in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A total of 512 patients with steady
warfarin taking were recruited from Beijing Hospital during May 2012
to December 2014. Indications for warfarin prescribing included prosthetic
heart valve, atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolism. Genomic DNAs
were extracted from blood samples and used for the genetic polymorphism
analysis of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 (include (*)3 and (*)13 alleles). Warfarin
dose, demographic variabilities and amiodarone compliance were recorded
during regular visit. These patients were randomly divided into groups
using the method of random number table, 384 patients were randomly
selected as derivation group, the remaining 128 cases as the validation
group.Using data from derivation group, a warfarin-dosing algorithm
was established based on the genetic information, demographic characteristics
and concomitant compliance by a  multiple linear regression analysis
parameter. Then the accuracy of newly developed algorithm method was
further evaluated by comparing the predicting dose with the actual
dose in the validation group. RESULTS: The stable dose of warfarin
was tightly associated with factors like age, height, weight, VKORC1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the major clinical factors affecting the quality
of anticoagulation and evaluate the predictive value of the SAMe-TT2R2
score to identify patients who will achieve a high average time in
therapeutic range (T.T.R.) with vitamin K antagonist (V.K.A.) treatment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, retrospective
and nationwide multicenter study included 1524 patients from the primary
care setting with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving V.K.A.
(>/=12 months). We performed a  bivariate analysis to identify factors
individually associated with the T.T.R. and a multiple regression analysis
to identify the independent predictive factors. For the validation
of the SAMe-TT2R2 score, the receiver operating characteristic (R.O.C.)
curve was calculated and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to test
calibration. RESULTS: A total of 94.8% of patients received acenocumarol
(4.8% warfarin). A progressive decrease in mean T.T.R. was found when
the SAMe-TT2R2 score increased from 0 points (72.1 +/- 17.1%) to 4
points (64.1 +/- 23.2%), p < 0.001. Other risk scores (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc,
HAS-BLED) were also associated with the mean T.T.R. We found a significant
association between low T.T.R. and the following clinical factors:
female sex, three or more comorbidities, amiodarone treatment, dietary
habits, bleeding history and the intake of >/=7 tablets per day besides
V.K.A. (p < 0.01). Regarding SAMe-TT2R2 score validation, the R.O.C.
curve showed significant capability, although not high, of discriminating
good anticoagulation control (T.T.R. >/=65%) with an area under the
curve of 0.562 (95% C.I. 0.533-0.592, p <  0.001) which increased,
remaining modest, to 0.594 (95% C.I. 0.564-0.624, p < 0.001) when the
factors not included in SAMe-TT2R2 score were added. CONCLUSION:  In
this cohort, the SAMe-TT2R2 score had a significant, although modest,
ability  to assess the likelihood of good international normalized
ration (I.N.R.) control, and its predictive value might slightly improve
by adding other simple clinical factors. Further research is needed
to refine the predictive scales.

 26933047   Barnes GD et al (2016) "Reimagining Anticoagulation Clinics in the Era of Direct Oral Anticoagulants." Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes 9(2), 182-185

Anticoagulation clinics were initially developed to provide safe and
effective care for warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation,
venous thromboembolism, and mechanical valve replacement. Traditionally,
these patients  required ongoing laboratory monitoring and warfarin
dose adjustment by expert providers. With the introduction of direct
oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban),
many have questioned the need for anticoagulation clinic. However,
we think that the growing number of oral anticoagulant choices creates
an urgent need for expanding the traditional role of the anticoagulation
clinic. We outline 3 key purposes that a reimagined anticoagulation
clinic would serve: (1) to assist patients and clinicians with selecting
the most appropriate drug and dose from a growing list of anticoagulant
options (including warfarin), (2) to help patients minimize the risk
of serious bleeding complications with careful long-term monitoring
and peri-procedural management, and (3) to encourage ongoing adherence
to these life-saving medications. We also describe how repurposing
anticoagulation clinics as broader  medication safety clinics would
promote safe and effective care across a range of cardiovascular conditions
for high-risk medications (eg, spironolactone, amiodarone). Finally,
we highlight a few existing health systems that are overcoming key
challenges to implementing a reimagined anticoagulation or medication
safety clinic structure.

 26892975   Khazanie P et al (2016) "Use of Heart Failure Medical Therapies Among Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices: Insights From INTERMACS." J Card Fail

BACKGROUND: Use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for treatment
of advanced heart failure has expanded significantly over the past
decade. However,  concomitant use of heart failure medical therapies
after implant is poorly characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined
the use of heart failure medications before and after LVAD implant
in adult patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically
Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) between 2008 and 2013 (N =
9359). Using logistic regression, we examined relationships between
patient characteristics and medication use at 3 months after implant.
Baseline rates of heart failure therapies before implant were 38%  for
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs), 55% for beta-blockers, 40% for mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists (MRAs), 87% for loop diuretics, 54% for amiodarone, 11%
for phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 22% for warfarin, and 54% for antiplatelet
agents.  By 3 months after implant, the rates were 50% for ACE inhibitors
or ARBs, 68% for beta-blockers, 33% for MRAs, 68% for loop diuretics,
42% for amiodarone, 21% for  phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 92% for
warfarin, and 84% for antiplatelet agents.  In general, age, preimplant
INTERMACS profile, and prior medication use were associated with medication
use at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Overall use of neurohormonal antagonists
was low after LVAD implant, whereas use of loop diuretics and amiodarone
remained high. Heart failure medication use is highly variable, but
appears to generally increase after LVAD implantation. Low neurohormonal
antagonist use may reflect practice uncertainty in the clinical utility
of these medications post-LVAD.

INTRODUCTION: The risk of complications in anticoagulation therapy
can be reduced by maximising the percentage of time spent by the patient
in the optimal therapeutic range (TTR). However, little is known about
the predictors of anticoagulation control. The aim of this paper was
to assess the quality of anticoagulant therapy in patients on warfarin
and to identify the factors affecting its deterioration. MATERIAL AND
METHODS: We studied 149 patients who required anticoagulant therapy
with warfarin due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation and/or venous
thromboembolism. Each patient underwent proper training regarding the
implemented treatment and remained under constant medical  care. RESULTS:
The mean age of the patients was 68.8 +/- 12.6 years, and 59% were
male. A total of 2460 international normalised ratio (INR) measurements
were collected during the 18-month period. The mean TTR in the studied
cohort was 76 +/- 21%, and the median was 80%. The level at which high-quality
anticoagulation  was recorded for this study was based on TTR values
above 80%. Seventy-five patients with TTR >/= 80% were included in
the stable anticoagulation group (TTR  >/= 80%); the remaining 74 patients
constituted the unstable anticoagulation group (TTR < 80%). According
to multivariate stepwise regression analysis, the independent variables
increasing the risk of deterioration of anticoagulation quality were:
arterial hypertension (OR 2.74 [CI 95%: 1.06-7.10]; p = 0.038), amiodarone
therapy (OR 4.22 [CI 95%: 1.30-13.70]; p = 0.017), and obesity (OR
1.11 [CI 95%: 1.02-1.21]; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of
obesity, hypertension, or amiodarone therapy decreases the quality
of anticoagulation with warfarin. High quality of anticoagulation can
be achieved through proper monitoring and education of patients.

One-third of women with heart disease use medication for the treatment
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during pregnancy. Increased plasma
volume, renal clearance, and liver enzyme activity in pregnant women
change the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, often resulting in the
need for an increased dose. Fetal well-being is a major concern among
pregnant women. Fortunately, many drugs used to treat CVD can be used
safely during pregnancy, with the exception of high-dose warfarin in
the first trimester, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor
blockers, amiodarone, and spironolactone. A timely and thorough discussion
between the cardiologist and the pregnant patient  about the potential
benefits and adverse effects of medication for CVD is important. Noncompliance
with necessary treatment for cardiovascular disorders endangers not
only the mother, but also the fetus. This Review is an overview of
the pharmacokinetic changes in medications for CVD during pregnancy
and the safety of these drugs for the fetus. The implications for maternal
treatment are  discussed. The Review also includes a short section
on the cardiovascular effects of medication used for obstetric indications.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data on mortality outcomes associated
with use of amiodarone in atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF). METHODS:
We evaluated the association of amiodarone use with mortality in patients
with newly diagnosed AF  using complete data from the Department of
Veterans Affairs national health care  system. We included patients
seen in an outpatient setting within 90 days of a new diagnosis for
nonvalvular AF between Veterans Affairs fiscal years 2004 and 2008.
Multivariate analysis and propensity-matched Cox proportional hazards
regression were used to evaluate the association of amiodarone use
to death. RESULTS: Of 122,465 patients (353,168 person-years of follow-up,
age 72.1 +/- 10.3 years, 98.4% males), amiodarone was prescribed in
11,655 (9.5%). Cumulative, unadjusted mortality rates were higher for
amiodarone recipients than for nonrecipients (87 vs 73 per 1,000 person-years,
P < .001). However, in multivariate and propensity-matched survival
analyses, there was no significant difference in mortality (multivariate
hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05, P = .51, and propensity-matched
hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.97-1.07, P = .45). The hazard of death
was not modified by age, sex, heart failure, kidney function, beta-blocker
use, or warfarin use, but there was evidence of effect modification
among patients diagnosed with AF as an inpatient versus outpatient.
CONCLUSION: In a national health care system population of newly diagnosed
AF, overall use of amiodarone as an early treatment strategy was not
associated with mortality.

 26537416   Stocks SJ et al (2015) "Examining variations in prescribing safety in UK general practice: cross sectional study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink." BMJ 351, h5501

STUDY QUESTION: What is the prevalence of different types of potentially
hazardous prescribing in general practice in the United Kingdom, and
what is the  variation between practices? METHODS: A cross sectional
study included all adult  patients potentially at risk of a prescribing
or monitoring error defined by a combination of diagnoses and prescriptions
in 526 general practices contributing  to the Clinical Practice Research
Datalink (CPRD) up to 1 April 2013. Primary outcomes were the prevalence
of potentially hazardous prescriptions of anticoagulants, anti-platelets,
NSAIDs, beta blockers, glitazones, metformin, digoxin, antipsychotics,
combined hormonal contraceptives, and oestrogens and monitoring by
blood test less frequently than recommended for patients with repeated
prescriptions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and loop
diuretics, amiodarone, methotrexate, lithium, or warfarin. STUDY ANSWER
AND LIMITATIONS: 49 927 of 949 552 patients at risk triggered at least
one prescribing indicator (5.26%, 95% confidence interval 5.21% to
5.30%) and 21 501  of 182 721 (11.8%, 11.6% to 11.9%) triggered at
least one monitoring indicator. The prevalence of different types of
potentially hazardous prescribing ranged from almost zero to 10.2%,
and for inadequate monitoring ranged from 10.4% to 41.9%. Older patients
and those prescribed multiple repeat medications had significantly
higher risks of triggering a prescribing indicator whereas younger
patients with fewer repeat prescriptions had significantly higher risk
of triggering a monitoring indicator. There was high variation between
practices for some indicators. Though prescribing safety indicators
describe prescribing patterns that can increase the risk of harm to
the patient and should generally be avoided, there will always be exceptions
where the indicator is clinically justified. Furthermore there is the
possibility that some information is not captured by CPRD for some
practices-for example, INR results in patients receiving warfarin.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The high prevalence for certain indicators emphasises
existing prescribing risks and the need for their appropriate consideration
within primary care, particularly for older patients and those taking
multiple medications. The high variation between practices indicates
potential for improvement through targeted practice level intervention.

BACKGROUND: In 21,105 patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE
AF-TIMI 48  trial, edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in preventing
thromboembolic events  while reducing bleeding. We compared results
in Japan with the rest of East Asia  (EA), including China, Korea,
and Taiwan. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared baseline characteristics,
time-in-therapeutic range (TTR) for warfarin, and outcomes (efficacy:
stroke or systemic embolic events [SEE], safety: major bleeding). Interaction
P values were used to assess for effect modification of treatment (higher-dose
edoxaban [HDE, 60 mg/30 mg] vs. warfarin; lower-dose edoxaban [LDE,
30 mg/15 mg] vs. warfarin) by region with adjustments for baseline
characteristics. Fewer patients in Japan (n=1,010) were female, taking
aspirin or amiodarone, naive to warfarin (P<0.001 for each), had a
history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (P=0.02), and more patients
needed dose reduction (P<0.001) compared with EA (n=933). The mean
TTR was higher in Japan (70% vs. 56%, P<0.001). Evidence for statistical
interactions was observed for HDE vs. warfarin by region for stroke/SEE
(adjusted P-int=0.052) and major bleeding (adjusted P-int=0.048) with
greater relative efficacy and safety with HDE in EA compared with Japan.
No interactions were observed for LDE vs. warfarin after adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: HDE had a greater relative efficacy and safety in EA compared
with Japan that was only partially explained by differences in baseline
characteristics and TTR.

 26355760   Alzubiedi S et al (2016) "Pharmacogenetic-guided Warfarin Dosing Algorithm in African-Americans." J Cardiovasc Pharmacol 67(1), 86-92

We aim to develop warfarin dosing algorithm for African-Americans.
We explored demographic, clinical, and genetic data from a previously
collected cohort of 163 African-American patients with a stable warfarin
dose. We explored 2 approaches to develop the algorithm: multiple linear
regression and artificial neural network (ANN). The clinical significance
of the 2 dosing algorithms was evaluated by calculating the percentage
of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin was within 20% of the
actual dose. Linear regression model and ANN model predicted the ideal
dose in 52% and 48% of the patients, respectively. The mean absolute
error using linear regression model was estimated to be 10.8 mg compared
with 10.9 mg using ANN. Linear regression and ANN models identified
several predictors of warfarin dose including age, weight, CYP2C9 genotype
*1/*1, VKORC1 genotype, rs12777823 genotype, rs2108622 genotype, congestive
heart failure, and amiodarone use. In conclusion, we developed a warfarin
dosing algorithm for African-Americans. The proposed dosing algorithm
has the potential to recommend warfarin doses that are close to the
appropriate doses. The use of more sophisticated ANN approach did not
result in improved predictive performance of the dosing algorithm except
for patients of a dose of >/=49 mg/wk.

 26309674   Yu Z et al (2015) "Warfarin dosage adjustment strategy in Chinese population." Int J Clin Exp Med 8(6), 9904-9910

BACKGROUND: Blood anticoagulation after heart valve replacement is
a recognized difficulty all over the world. In this study, we identified
the effect of amiodarone on the function of warfarin and confirmed
the countermeasure by concluding the genotype distribution of vitamin
K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9)
of the patient to predict the security  dose of warfarin. METHODS:
Studying on the VKORC1 (-1639G>A) and CYP2C9 genotype  of 271 cases
on heart valve replacement in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow
University from Jan. 2012 to Jan. 2014. Warfarin's multivariable regression
equation was taken to calculate their warfarin dosage. In the study,
80 of them were selected and divided into 4 groups according to their
different warfarin dosage and their usage of amiodaron. The differences
of INR values at the 5(th), 8(th), 11(th), 14(th) days of operation
were analyzed. RESULTS: Among  the 80 cases, VKORC1 (-1639G>A) AA types
accounted for 90%, and AG types accounted for another 10%, while GG
types were not found. In addition that, all of the patients (100%)
had CYP2C9*1/*1 type, and CYP2C9*1/*3 had not appeared. There was significant
difference in INR values between the groups who used amiodarone or
not. The pharmacogenetic equation was accurate in the predicting of
the warfarin dosage, so that satisfied anticoagulation efficacy had
been achieved in 2 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: It is necessary
for the patients to do the  warfarin pharmacogenetic test to get the
suitable dose before heart valve replacement. Amiodarone can enhance
the anticoagulant efficacy of warfarin, so the dosages of warfarin
should be reduced properly because of the medicine combination, and
INR values must be monitored more frequently to make the anticoagulant
process secure and efficient.

In this study, IC50 shift and time-dependent inhibition (TDI) experiments
were carried out to measure the ability of amiodarone (AMIO), and its
circulating human metabolites, to reversibly and irreversibly inhibit
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes.
The [I]u/Ki,u values were calculated and used to predict in vivo AMIO
drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for pharmaceuticals metabolized by these
four enzymes. Based on these values, the minor metabolite N,N-didesethylamiodarone
(DDEA) is predicted to be the major cause of DDIs with xenobiotics
primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP3A4, while AMIO and
its N-monodesethylamiodarone (MDEA) derivative are the most likely
cause of interactions involving inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism. AMIO
drug interactions predicted from the reversible inhibition of the four
P450 activities were found to be in good agreement with the magnitude
of reported clinical DDIs with lidocaine, warfarin, metoprolol, and
simvastatin. The TDI experiments showed DDEA to be a potent inactivator
of CYP1A2 (KI = 0.46 muM, kinact = 0.030 minute(-1)), while MDEA was
a moderate inactivator of both CYP2D6  (KI = 2.7 muM, kinact = 0.018
minute(-1)) and CYP3A4 (KI = 2.6 muM, kinact = 0.016 minute(-1)). For
DDEA and MDEA, mechanism-based inactivation appears to occur through
formation of a metabolic intermediate complex. Additional metabolic
studies strongly suggest that CYP3A4 is the primary microsomal enzyme
involved in the metabolism of AMIO to both MDEA and DDEA. In summary,
these studies demonstrate both the diversity of inhibitory mechanisms
with AMIO and the need to consider metabolites as the culprit in inhibitory
P450-based DDIs.

 26296048   Stollberger C et al (2015) "Fatal intracerebral bleeding under rivaroxaban." Int J Cardiol 201, 110-112

Rivaroxaban is a factor-Xa-inhibitor which has been shown to be non-inferior
to the vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA) warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients.
In the manufacturer-sponsored trial, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage
in rivaroxaban-treated patients was lower than in VKA-treated. It is
unknown if this advantage of rivaroxaban is also present outside clinical
trials. We report a patient with fatal cerebral bleeding 4months after
initiation of rivaroxaban. Bleeding might be favored by hypertension,
hypoalbuminemia, renal impairment, hepatopathy and drug-drug interactions
of rivaroxaban with amiodarone and bisoprolol. Patients have to be
monitored closely after initiation of rivaroxaban, especially if they
are treated with possibly interacting drugs. Additionally, hepatic
function, albumin level, and renal function have to be closely monitored.
Therapy with VKA seems more convenient, safer and more favorable for
the patient than rivaroxaban with its associated uncertainties concerning
metabolization and drug-drug interactions and no possibility to reverse
its activity in emergency situations.

Clinical trials have reported a low time in therapeutic range (TTR)
in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with both warfarin andamiodarone.
These trials included centers and countries with both high and low
TTRs. What is the impact of amiodarone on the TTR in a single, high-quality
anticoagulation clinic? TTR was assessed in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated
patients from a University anticoagulation clinic. Baseline characteristics
between patients ever-taking or  never-taking amiodarone were similar,
except more amiodarone patients were smokers (19.5 vs. 6.1%, P = 0.0031).
The TTR calculated from 8901international normalized ratios (INRs)
in 249 nonamiodarone patients with a mean follow-up of 34 +/- 20 months
(mean INR 36 +/- 18) was 66 +/- 16.6% compared with 61.3 +/- 16.2%
(P = 0.111) from 1455 INRs in 41 amiodarone-treated patients with a
mean follow-up of 28 +/- 20 months (mean INR 35 +/- 22). Factors associated
with a low TTR were male sex (P = 0.0013), smoker (P = 0.0048), and
amiodarone use (P = 0.0374). A second on-treatment analysis, in which
the TTR was calculated only during amiodarone therapy, resulted in
similar findings; however, amiodarone did  not emerge as a predictor
of a low TTR. In 11 patients, the TTR prior to amiodarone (54.5 +/-
22.2%) was not significantly different in the first 3 months (54.6
+/- 33.4%) or after 3 months (67.2 +/- 33.7%) of amiodarone. In a single
high-quality anticoagulation center, anticoagulation quality, as measured
by the  TTR, can be comparable in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated
patients.

Cardiorenal syndrome type 5 (CRS-5) includes conditions where there
is a simultaneous involvement of the heart and kidney from a systemic
disorder. This is a bilateral organ cross talk. Fabry's disease (FD)
is a devastating progressive inborn error of metabolism with lysosomal
glycosphingolipid deposition in variety of cell types, capillary endothelial
cells, renal, cardiac  and nerve cells. Basic effect is absent or deficient
activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase a-galactosidase A. Renal involvement
consists of proteinuria, isosthenuria, altered tubular function, presenting
in second or third decade leading to azotemia and end-stage renal disease
in third to fifth decade mainly due to irreversible changes to glomerular,
tubular and vascular structures, especially highlighted by podocytes
foot process effacement. Cardiac involvement  consists of left ventricular
hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias (sinus node
and conduction system impairment), diastolic dysfunction, myocardial
ischemia, infarction, transmural replacement fibrosis, congestive heart
failure and cardiac death. Management of FD is based on enzymatic replacement
therapy and control of renal (with anti-proteinuric agents such as
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors-and/or angiotensin II receptor
blockers), brain (coated aspirin, clopidogrel and statin to prevent
strokes) and  heart complications (calcium channel blockers for ischemic
cardiomyopathy, warfarin and amiodarone or cardioverter device for
arrhythmias).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Advantages of new oral anticoagulations may
be greater in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients of poor anticoagulation
control with warfarin.  The SAMe-TT2R2 scoring system, based on clinical
variables, was recently developed to aid in identifying these patients.
In this study, we investigated the association of this clinical composite
score with genetic factors related warfarin dosing and the quality
of anticoagulation control. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data were
collected from 380 consecutive Korean patients with AF (CHA2DS2-VASc
score, 3.5+/-1.8) who were followed for an average of 4 years. We evaluated
factors associated with time in therapeutic range (TTR, INR 2-3), including
the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes and the SAMe-TT2R2 score (Sex female,
Age <60 years, Medical history [>two co-morbidities], Treatment [interacting
drugs, e.g., amiodarone], Tobacco use within 2 years [doubled], and
Race non-white [doubled]). RESULTS: The average SAMe-TT2R2 score was
3.4+/-0.9, range  2-7; and 153 patients (40.2%) had SAMe-TT2R2 scores
>/=4. Time in specific INR ranges varied depending on the VKORC1 genotype
but not with the CYP2C9 genotype or the SAMe-TT2R2 score. TTR was higher
in patients with the VKORC1 1173C>T than  in VKORC1 TT (61.7+/-16%
vs. 56.7+/-17.4%, P=0.031). Multivariate testing showed  that VKORC1
genotype but not the SAMe-TT2R2 score was significantly associated
with labile INRs. There was no correlation between the SAMe-TT2R2 scores
and pharmacogenetic data. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic factor, but none of
the common clinical and demographic factors, as combined in the SAMe-TT2R2
score, was associated with the quality of anticoagulation control in
Korean patients with AF.

BACKGROUND: The main aims of the present study were to develop a pharmacogenetic-based
warfarin dosing algorithm and to validate it in a highly admixed population.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We included two patient cohorts treated  with
warfarin (first cohort, n = 832; and second cohort, n = 133). RESULTS:
Our algorithm achieved a determination coefficient of 40% including
the variables age, gender, weight, height, self-declared race, amiodarone
use, enzyme inducers  use, VKORC1 genotypes and predicted phenotypes
according to CYP2C9 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that our
developed algorithm is more accurate than the IWPC algorithm when the
application is focused on patients from the Brazilian population. Population-specific
derivation and/or calibration of warfarin dosing  algorithms may lead
to improved performance compared with general use dosing algorithms
currently available. Original submitted 26 November 2014; Revision

Warfarin dosing algorithms adjust for race, assigning a fixed effect
size to each predictor, thereby attenuating the differential effect
by race. Attenuation likely occurs in both race groups but may be more
pronounced in the less-represented race group. Therefore, we evaluated
whether the effect of clinical (age, body surface area [BSA], chronic
kidney disease [CKD], and amiodarone use) and genetic factors (CYP2C9*2,
*3, *5, *6, *11, rs12777823, VKORC1, and CYP4F2) on warfarin dose differs
by race using regression analyses among 1357 patients enrolled in a
prospective cohort study and compared predictive ability of race-combined
vs race-stratified models. Differential effect of predictors by race
was assessed using predictor-race interactions in race-combined analyses.
Warfarin dose was influenced by age, BSA, CKD, amiodarone use, and
CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 variants in both races, by CYP2C9*2 and CYP4F2
variants in European Americans, and by rs12777823 in African Americans.
CYP2C9*2  was associated with a lower dose only among European Americans
(20.6% vs 3.0%, P  < .001) and rs12777823 only among African Americans
(12.3% vs 2.3%, P = .006). Although VKORC1 was associated with dose
decrease in both races, the proportional decrease was higher among
European Americans (28.9% vs 19.9%, P = .003) compared  with African
Americans. Race-stratified analysis improved dose prediction in both
race groups compared with race-combined analysis. We demonstrate that
the effect  of predictors on warfarin dose differs by race, which may
explain divergent findings reported by recent warfarin pharmacogenetic
trials. We recommend that warfarin dosing algorithms should be stratified
by race rather than adjusted for  race.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia requiring
treatment worldwide, is one of the major causes of ischemic stroke.
Although amiodarone is commonly used for rhythm control in AF, its
relationship with stroke has rarely been addressed.We evaluated 16,091
patients who were diagnosed  with AF (Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 427.31 and 427.32) between
1998 and 2011; the date of AF diagnosis was set as the index date.
Patients with a history of stroke (ICD-9-CM 430-438) who received amiodarone
before the index date or during the following 30 days, or who experienced
stroke within 30 days of receiving amiodarone were excluded. Finally,
7548 patients with AF were included in this study and divided into
2 groups according to whether they received amiodarone (Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical code C01BD01) during the study period.The risk
of ischemic stroke in AF patients  receiving amiodarone was 1.81-fold
(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-2.16), 1.79-fold (95% CI 1.50-2.14),
and 1.78-fold (95% CI 1.49-2.13) higher than in those who did not receive
amiodarone, according to crude, Model 1, and Model 2 Cox proportional
hazard regression models, respectively. In a demographically stratified
analysis, the risk of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in patients
aged <65 years, with no comorbidities, who were also taking digoxin
or had a low CHA2DS2VASc score.Amiodarone treatment is associated with
an increased  risk of stroke in patients with AF, especially in those
who have an initial low risk of stroke. Antiplatelet drugs and warfarin
could reduce the stroke risk in AF patients receiving amiodarone. However,
as the combination of digoxin and amiodarone increases the risk of
stroke in these patients, the combination of these 2 drugs should be
avoided.

BACKGROUND: In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, the higher-dose edoxaban
(HDE) regimen had a similar incidence of ischaemic stroke compared
with warfarin, whereas a higher incidence was observed with the lower-dose
regimen (LDE). Amiodarone increases edoxaban plasma levels via P-glycoprotein
inhibition. The current pre-specified exploratory analysis was performed
to determine the effect  of amiodarone on the relative efficacy and
safety profile of edoxaban. METHODS AND RESULTS: At randomization,
2492 patients (11.8%) were receiving amiodarone. The primary efficacy
endpoint of stroke or systemic embolic event was significantly lower
with LDE compared with warfarin in amiodarone treated patients vs.
patients not on amiodarone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence
intervals [CIs] 0.36-0.99 and HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.40, respectively;
P interaction <0.01). In patients randomized to HDE, no such interaction
for efficacy was observed (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46-1.17 vs. HR 0.89, 95%
CI 0.75-1.05, P interaction = 0.446). Major bleeding was similar in
patients on LDE (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.59 vs. HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.46-0.61,
P interaction = 0.131) and HDE (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65-1.38 vs. HR 0.79,
95% CI 0.69-0.90, P interaction = 0.392) when compared with warfarin,
independent of amiodarone use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized to
the LDE treated with amiodarone at the time of randomization demonstrated
a significant reduction in ischaemic events vs. warfarin when compared
with those not on amiodarone, while preserving a favourable bleeding
profile. In contrast, amiodarone had no effect on the relative efficacy
and safety of HDE.

We designed a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point
evaluation parallel group Phase 3b clinical trial comparing edoxaban
(a new oral factor Xa inhibitor) with enoxaparin/warfarin followed
by warfarin alone in subjects undergoing planned electrical cardioversion
of non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  The primary efficacy end point
is the composite end points of stroke, systemic embolic event, myocardial
infarction, and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, from randomization until
the end of follow-up (day 56 post cardioversion). The primary safety
end point is the composite of major and clinically-relevant non-major
bleeding, from the first administration of study drug to end of treatment
(Day 28 post cardioversion) +3 days. The primary efficacy analysis
will be conducted on the intention-to-treat population whereas the
primary safety analysis, on the safety population. The study includes
stratification on the following levels: (i) approach to cardioversion
(transoesophagel echocardiography or non-transoesophagel echocardiography)
as determined by the Investigator; (ii) subject's experience in taking
anticoagulants at the time of randomization (anticoagulant-experienced
or anticoagulant-naive); and (iii) assigned edoxaban dose (full 60
mg QD or reduced 30 mg dose QD). A subject with one or more factors
(CrCl >/=15 mL/min and </=50 mL/min, low body weight [</=60 kg], and
concomitant  use of p-pg inhibitors (excluding amiodarone) will receive
a reduced dose (30 mg) of edoxaban if the subject is randomized to
the edoxaban group. ENSURE-AF will be the largest prospective randomised
trial of anticoagulation for cardioversion, also involving a Non-VKA
Oral Anticoagulant-edoxaban.

It has been well established that patient self-testing (PST) of international
normalized ratio (INR) using home monitoring devices increases the
average therapeutic time and patient satisfaction. Long-term anticoagulation
therapy with warfarin is used in patients with continuous-flow left
ventricular assist device  (CF-LVAD) to minimize the occurrence of
thromboembolic events; however, PST devices have never been tested
in patients with CF-LVADs. The purpose of this study was to determine
the reliability of the PST device Alere INRatio 2 in patients supported
with CF-LVADs. A correlation study was performed in 50 patients with
CF-LVAD who were on stable warfarin therapy for a minimum of 3 weeks.
Simultaneous INR values were determined from capillary whole blood
samples using the Alere PST device and venous blood samples processed
in the core laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center. There
was a moderate correlation between the venous and the capillary INR
values with a correlation coefficient of 0.83. The median difference
between the methods was 0.39, with 44  of 50 patients recording higher
INRs with Alere. Results remained unchanged after adjusting for use
of amiodarone, abnormal hematocrit and liver enzymes, creatinine, and
thyroid-stimulating hormone. Point of care testing with Alere correlates
moderately well but consistently overestimates INR when compared with
conventional laboratory testing in patients with CF-LVAD.

 25905259   Macchia PE (2000) "Amiodarone Induced Thyrotoxicosis"

Patients treated with Amiodarone for cardiac arrhythmia may develop
Amiodarone Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT). AIT manifests with clinical
signs indistinguishable from spontaneous hyperthyroidism, however evidence
of thyrotoxicosis is not apparent in all patients, and may be obscured
by an underlying cardiac condition. The reappearance or exacerbation
of an underlying cardiac disorder after amiodarone is started, in a
patient previously stable, should prompt an investigation into thyroid
function for suspected development of AIT. Sometimes worsening of cardiac
arrhythmia with recurrence of atrial fibrillation and palpitations
is the only clinical evidence of AIT. Similarly, unexplained changes
in warfarin sensitivity, requiring a reduction in the dosage of this
drug, can be the consequence of increased thyroid hormone levels, since
hyperthyroidism increases warfarin effects.

 25830869   Saleh MI (2015) "Clinical Predictors Associated With Warfarin Sensitivity." Am J Ther

Our study aimed to identify predictors of warfarin sensitivity like
demographic,  clinical, and genetic data from a previously collected
cohort of patients (n = 4272) with a stable warfarin dose who were
able to achieve an observed international normalized ratio of 2-3.
Predictors of warfarin sensitivity (dose </=21 mg/wk) were identified
using a 2-stage approach. First, bivariate analysis, using analysis
of variance for continuous variables and chi test for categorical  variables,
was performed to identify possible predictors of warfarin sensitivity
(P < 0.05). Second, logistic regression with backward stepwise selection
was then performed using predictors identified in bivariate analysis
step to produce final model containing independent predictors at P
< 0.05. Increased warfarin sensitivity was associated with increased
age; CYP2C9 genotypes 2/3, 1/3, and 3/3; VKORC1 genotypes AA and AG;
and amiodarone use. Decreased warfarin sensitivity (ie, weekly warfarin
dose of >21 mg) was associated with increased height, increased weight,
having diabetes mellitus, VKORC1 genotype GG, and CYP2C9 genotype 1/1.
In conclusion, we identified patients' characteristics associated with
warfarin sensitivity. This project is expected to improve patient care
by identifying patients who need a low warfarin dose before warfarin
administration. Early identification of this subset of patients helps
minimize the incidence of bleeding.

 25812113   Angoulvant D et al (2015) "Effect of Active Smoking on Comparative Efficacy of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: The Loire Valley Atrial Fibrillation Project." Chest 148(2), 491-498

BACKGROUND: Active smoking is associated with elevated thrombotic risk.
Smoking status has recently been incorporated into the SAMe-TT2R2 (sex
female, age < 60 years, medical history [more than two comorbidities],
treatment [interacting drugs, eg, amiodarone for rhythm control], tobacco
use [doubled], race [doubled]) score that can help predict poor international
normalized ratio control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The clinical benefit of
antiplatelet therapy (APT) has been seen primarily in smokers. We hypothesized
that active smoking may differently influence the risks  of stroke
and bleeding in patients with AF treated with VKAs or with APT. METHODS:
We examined the clinical course of 7,809 consecutive patients with
AF seen between 2000 and 2010. Outcomes in patients who were active
smokers were compared with those in other patients. RESULTS: Among
7,809 patients with AF, 1,034 (13%) were active smokers. APT was prescribed
on an individual basis for 2,761 patients (35%) and VKAs for 4,534
(57%). After a follow-up of 929 +/- 1,082 days (median = 463 days,
interquartile range = 1,564 days), smoking was not independently associated
with a higher risk of stroke/thromboembolic event in patients with
AF (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.22; P = .66). On multivariate
analysis, smoking was independently associated with a worse prognosis
for the risk of severe bleeding (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.49; P = .04)
and for the risk of major Bleeding Academic Research Consortium bleeding
(HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.90; P = .03). Smoking was independently associated
with a higher risk of bleeding in patients treated with VKAs (HR, 1.32;
95% CI, 1.04-1.67; P = .02), whereas the risk was nonsignificant in
patients treated with APT (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.94-1.74; P = .11). CONCLUSIONS:
In AF, there was a higher risk of severe bleeding in smokers, mainly
in those treated with VKAs.

 25628141   Li X et al (2015) "Clinical benefits of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials." Thromb Res 135(4), 621-629

BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetic (PG) algorithms were proposed to predict
warfarin therapeutic dose more accurately. However, the clinical efficacy
of the strategy  over the standard treatment was not consistently proven.
METHODS: We conducted a  meta-analysis of the published randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PG algorithm-based warfarin dosing
(PG group) with clinical or standard protocols (STD group). The PUBMED,
EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched
up to June 2014. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were retrieved for the
meta-analysis with the inclusion of 2,601 participants. Primary analysis
showed both major bleeding (2.65% versus 4.75%; RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37-
0.90, P=0.02) and thromboembolic events (0.59% versus 1.88%; RR: 0.38,
95% CI: 0.17-0.85, P=0.02) were significantly lower in PG than in STD
group. There was a trend towards increased percentage of time in therapeutic
range (%TTR) [mean difference (MD): 4.65, 95% CI: 0.01- 9.29, P=0.05]
in PG group, but no difference was observed for over-anticoagulation
(INR>4). Subgroup analyses showed significant reduction of both major
bleeding and thromboembolic events in PG group when the follow-up time
was more than 1 month. After stratified by different PG algorithms,
significant major bleeding reduction could be found in PG group when
warfarin indication or co-medication of amiodarone was integrated in
the algorithms. CONCLUSION: PG algorithm-guided warfarin anticoagulation
is beneficial for the reduction of both major bleeding and thromboembolic
events compared with standard dosing strategy. The benefits may be
prominent in patients with longer follow-up time, or guided by refined
PG algorithms.

BACKGROUND: The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilate,
rivaroxaban, and apixaban show similar efficacy for stroke prevention
in patients with atrial  fibrillation (AF) as the vitamin K antagonist
warfarin. Absorption of NOACs is dependent on the intestinal P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) system and P-gp activity is modulated by a variety of drugs
and food components. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to give an
overview of P-gp-associated drug-drug and drug-food interactions with
NOACs in AF patients. METHODS: A literature search was carried  out
by screening MEDLINE for the terms dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban,
P-glycoprotein, and atrial fibrillation from 1998 to 2013. Randomized
clinical trials, longitudinal studies, case series, and case reports
were included. RESULTS: Concomitant medication with proton pump inhibitors,
amiodarone, clarithromycin, and verapamil increased bioavailability
whereas rifampicin decreased the bioavailability of dabigatran. Coadministration
of erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and ritonavir
increased rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. No data were found on
apixaban and P-gp-modulating drugs or on NOACs and food components
modulating P-gp. The clinical relevance of interactions between NOACs
and P-gp-modulating drugs or food components is largely unknown as
bleeding complications under NOACs and P-gp-inhibiting drugs are mainly
reported from patients with concomitant renal failure. CONCLUSION:
There is an urgent need to investigate the role of P-gp-modulating
substances as  potential sources of drug-drug and drug-food interactions.
A thorough analysis of the data accumulated in the three large NOAC
trials regarding the role of P-gp-modulating drugs in bleeding and
embolic events is desirable. Pharmacological studies should investigate
the influence of P-gp-modulating drugs and food on NOAC plasma concentrations
and coagulation parameters. When prescribing NOACs, patients should
be informed about the potential interactions with drugs and herbal
drugs. Patients who develop bleeding or embolic events under treatment
with NOACs should be investigated for co-medications as well as for
over-the-counter drugs and dietary habits. In post-marketing surveillance
of  NOACs, the association with drug or food intake with complications,
bleeding, and embolic events should be registered.

A 69-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of shortness of breath
on exertion, unintentional weight loss, altered bowel habits and lethargy.
He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 2 years previously and started
on amiodarone and warfarin. He subsequently reverted to sinus rhythm
and his medication was stopped 1 year prior to presentation. He denied
history of thyroid dysfunction. On examination, he had a small firm
goitre of grade I. His skin was warm and sweaty. Thyroid function tests
showed him to be thyrotoxic. He was started on carbimazole 20 mg; however,
he further became significantly thyrotoxic. Given the severity of his
presentation and lack of any clinical or biochemical improvement, oral
prednisolone 30 mg once daily was coadministered. His symptoms subsequently
resolved and he became euthyroid. The prednisolone was tapered down
and stopped while the carbimazole was incrementally reduced to 10 mg
daily.

Evaluation of drug-drug interaction (DDI) involving circulating inhibitory
metabolites of perpetrator drugs has recently drawn more attention
from regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies. Here, using
amiodarone (AMIO) as an example, we demonstrate the use of physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to assess how a potential inhibitory
metabolite can contribute to clinically significant DDIs. Amiodarone
was reported to increase the exposure of  simvastatin, dextromethorphan,
and warfarin by 1.2- to 2-fold, which was not expected based on its
weak inhibition observed in vitro. The major circulating metabolite,
mono-desethyl-amiodarone (MDEA), was later identified to have a more
potent inhibitory effect. Using a combined "bottom-up" and "top-down"
approach, a PBPK model was built to successfully simulate the pharmacokinetic
profile of AMIO and MDEA, particularly their accumulation in plasma
and liver after a long-term treatment. The clinical AMIO DDIs were
predicted using the verified PBPK model with incorporation of cytochrome
P450 inhibition from both AMIO and MDEA. The closest prediction was
obtained for CYP3A (simvastatin) DDI when the competitive  inhibition
from both AMIO and MDEA was considered, for CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan)
DDI when the competitive inhibition from AMIO and the competitive plus
time-dependent inhibition from MDEA were incorporated, and for CYP2C9
(warfarin)  DDI when the competitive plus time-dependent inhibition
from AMIO and the competitive inhibition from MDEA were considered.
The PBPK model with the ability to simulate DDI by considering dynamic
change and accumulation of inhibitor (parent and metabolite) concentration
in plasma and liver provides advantages in  understanding the possible
mechanism of clinical DDIs involving inhibitory metabolites.

BACKGROUND: Amiodarone is an effective medication in preventing atrial
fibrillation (AF), but it interferes with the metabolism of warfarin.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the association of major thrombotic
clinical events  and bleeding with the use of amiodarone in the ARISTOTLE
(Apixaban for Reduction  in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events
in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. METHODS: Baseline characteristics of
patients who received amiodarone at randomization were compared with
those who did not receive amiodarone. The interaction between  randomized
treatment and amiodarone was tested using a Cox model, with main effects
for randomized treatment and amiodarone and their interaction. Matching
on the basis of a propensity score was used to compare patients who
received and  who did not receive amiodarone at the time of randomization.
RESULTS: In ARISTOTLE, 2,051 (11.4%) patients received amiodarone at
randomization. Patients  on warfarin and amiodarone had time in the
therapeutic range that was lower than  patients not on amiodarone (56.5%
vs. 63.0%; p < 0.0001). More amiodarone-treated patients had a stroke
or a systemic embolism (1.58%/year vs. 1.19%/year; adjusted hazard
ratio [HR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.10; p = 0.0322).
Overall mortality and major bleeding rates were elevated, but were
not significantly different in amiodarone-treated patients and patients
not on amiodarone. When comparing apixaban with warfarin, patients
who received amiodarone had a stroke or a systemic embolism rate of
1.24%/year versus 1.85%/year (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.15), death
of 4.15%/year versus 5.65%/year (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.98), and
major bleeding of 1.86%/year versus 3.06%/year (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39
to 0.96). In patients who did not receive amiodarone, the stroke or
systemic embolism rate was 1.29%/year versus 1.57%/year (HR: 0.82,
95% CI: 0.68 to 1.00), death was 3.43%/year versus 3.68%/year (HR:
0.93, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.05), and major bleeding was 2.18%/year versus
3.03%/year (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.84). The interaction p values
for  amiodarone use by apixaban treatment effects were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone use was associated with significantly increased
stroke and systemic embolism risk and a lower time in the therapeutic
range when used with warfarin.  Apixaban consistently reduced the rate
of stroke and systemic embolism, death, and major bleeding compared
with warfarin in amiodarone-treated patients and patients who were
not on amiodarone.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features and current therapy
of atrial fibrillation (AF) of inpatients in Urumqi, China. METHODS:
The clinical data of inpatients diagnosed with AF from January, 2008
to December, 2012, in 12 hospitals in Urumqi were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Totally 1 310 AF inpatients were enrolled in this study with
the age of (64.8 +/- 3.3) years old and a men to women ratio of 1.39.
Most patients were in age groups of 61-70 years (26.5%) and 71-80 years
(27.6%). More patients with paroxysmal AF were at cardiac function
class I-II (75.2%), while more patients with persistent AF were at
cardiac function class III-IV (31.0%) (both P values < 0.05). The most
common co-morbidities of AF were hypertension (49.2%), coronary heart
disease (38.5%), diabetes mellitus (20.1%). Compared with patients
of chronic AF, the patients of  paroxysmal AF had higher success rates
in amiodarone conversation and sinus rhythm maintenance after ablation
(44.8% vs 29.9%, 87.5% vs 68.9%, P values < 0.05). Among the 1 310
inpatients, 992 patients (75.7%) received antithrombotic therapy. There
were statistically significant differences in CHA2DS2 score and incidence
rate of cerebral infarction among patients receiving aspirin, warfarin
or rivaroxaban/other anticoagulation drugs [2(1, 3) vs 3(2, 4) vs 3(2,
5) and 6.3% vs 23.8% vs 30.2%, both P values < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Our
results of AF inpatients' age, gender, related disease distribution,
AF types, incidence of stoke, therapeutic and epidemiological features
are in accordance with the domestic and abroad reports.

 25137168   Sanchez Gomez E et al (2014) "[Review of pharmacological interactions of oral anticancer drugs provided at pharmacy department]." Farm Hosp 38(4), 338-363

OBJECTIVE: To identify the pharmacologic interactions of oral anti-cancer
drugs provided at an outpatient clinic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anti-cancer
drugs included in the Phamacotherapeutic Guideline of the Hospital
were identified. A literature search was carried out on the pharmacologic
interactions in MEDLINE(R) and EMBASE(R) (with the filer language English
or Spanish, and the descriptors: "name of the anti-cancer drug" AND
("drug interactions" OR "pharmacokinetic")), Up-to-date(R), MICROMEDEX(R)
and the drug information sheet for the EMA and the FDA. Information
was also gathered from the abstract presented to European and Spanish
scientific meetings for the last 4 years. When an interaction was analyzed
and had clinical relevance, the best pharmacotherapeutic interaction-free
alternative was sought. RESULTS: Twenty-three drugs were identified,
of which Chlorambucil, Fludarabine, Lenalidomide, Melphalan, and Thalidomide
were the active compounds with the lowest likelihood of producing a
pharmacologic interaction. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (particularly
Erlotinib, Imatinib, Lapatinib, and Pazopanib) are the drugs with highest
number of pharmacologic interactions described, many of them with severe
clinical consequences, with increases and decreases of the plasma levels
of anti-cancer drugs. The active compounds identified that may have
pharmacologic interactions with anticancer drugs were mainly: Allopurinol,
Amiodarone, Carbamazepine, Dabigatran, Digoxin, Spironolactone, Phenytoin,
Itraconazol, Repaglinide, Silodosin, Tamoxifen, Verapamil, and Warfarin.
Pharmacologic interactions through the cytochrome P450 1A2, 2D6, 2C8,
2C9, 3A4 were the most important for tyrosine  kinase inhibitors. Other
non-pharmacologic compounds, with an important potential of producing
relevant pharmacologic interaction were immunomodulators (Echinacea
extracts) and Hypericum perforatum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral anticancer drugs
have numerous pharmacologic interactions that should be monitored during
pharmacotherapy. Given its position, the hospital pharmacist is the
key professional for identifying and assessing the pharmacologic interactions
or oral anticancer drugs that may have clinical consequences.

Inconsistent associations with warfarin dose were observed in genetic
variants except VKORC1 haplotype and CYP2C9*3 in Chinese people, and
few studies on warfarin dose algorithm was performed in a large Chinese
Han population lived in  Northern China. Of 787 consenting patients
with heart-valve replacements who were receiving long-term warfarin
maintenance therapy, 20 related Single nucleotide polymorphisms were
genotyped. Only VKORC1 and CYP2C9 SNPs were observed to be significantly
associated with warfarin dose. In the derivation cohort (n = 551),
warfarin dose variability was influenced, in decreasing order, by VKORC1
rs7294 (27.3%), CYP2C9*3(7.0%), body surface area(4.2%), age(2.7%),
target INR(1.4%), CYP4F2 rs2108622 (0.7%), amiodarone use(0.6%), diabetes
mellitus(0.6%), and digoxin use(0.5%), which account for 45.1% of the
warfarin dose variability. In the validation cohort (n = 236), the
actual maintenance dose was significantly correlated with predicted
dose (r = 0.609, P<0.001). Our algorithm could improve  the personalized
management of warfarin use in Northern Chinese patients.

BACKGROUND: Despite endorsement of digoxin in clinical practice guidelines,
there exist limited data on its safety in atrial fibrillation/flutter
(AF). OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the association
of digoxin with mortality  in AF. METHODS: Using complete data of the
TREAT-AF (The Retrospective Evaluation and Assessment of Therapies
in AF) study from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare
system, we identified patients with newly diagnosed, nonvalvular AF
seen within 90 days in an outpatient setting between VA fiscal years
2004 and 2008. We used multivariate and propensity-matched Cox proportional
hazards to evaluate the association of digoxin use with death. Residual
confounding was assessed by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Of 122,465
patients with 353,168 person-years of follow-up (age 72.1 +/- 10.3
years, 98.4% male), 28,679 (23.4%) patients received digoxin. Cumulative
mortality rates were higher  for digoxin-treated patients than for
untreated patients (95 vs. 67 per 1,000 person-years; p < 0.001). Digoxin
use was independently associated with mortality after multivariate
adjustment (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1.23 to 1.29, p < 0.001) and propensity matching (HR: 1.21, 95% CI:
1.17 to 1.25, p < 0.001), even after adjustment for drug adherence.
The risk of death was not modified by age, sex, heart failure, kidney
function, or concomitant use of beta-blockers, amiodarone, or warfarin.
CONCLUSIONS: Digoxin was associated with  increased risk of death in
patients with newly diagnosed AF, independent of drug  adherence, kidney
function, cardiovascular comorbidities, and concomitant therapies.
These findings challenge current cardiovascular society recommendations
on use of digoxin in AF.

OBJECTIVES: To establish an algorithm to predict the warfarin maintenance
dose in Chinese Han population and validate the accuracy of this algorithm.
METHODS: A total of 488 Chinese Han patients, hospitalized in Fuwai
hospital and had a stable dose of warfarin and a target international
normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5  to 3.0, were recruited. Indications
for warfarin use included prosthetic heart valve, atrial fibrillation
and pulmonary embolism. These patients were divided into derivation
group (n = 323) and validation group (n = 165) according to the enrollment
time. A warfarin maintenance dose algorithm was established based on
genetic information, demographic characteristics and concomitant medications
by multiple linear regression analysis in derivation group. In the
validation group, we evaluated the accuracy of our algorithm by comparing
the predicted dose with the actual dose. RESULTS: Our algorithm included
VKORC1-1639G > A, CYP2C9*3 and CYP4F2 genotype, age, Body hight, body
weight, amiodarone and digoxin use (R(2) = 0.652, P < 0.001) .In the
validation group, the average predicted dose by our algorithm had no
statistical difference with the actual dose [(3.51 +/- 1.03) mg  vs.
(3.53 +/- 1.41) mg, P = 0.779]. Our algorithm identified 100 out of
165 (60.6%) patients in the validation group, whose predicted dose
of warfarin was within 20% of the actual dose, and predicted warfarin
dose was underestimated in  17.6% (29/165) patients and overestimated
in 21.8% (36/165) patients. CONCLUSION: Our algorithm based on VKORC1,
CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 polymorphisms can help to predict the warfarin maintenance
dose in Chinese Han Population.

BACKGROUND: Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and anticoagulation are mainstays
of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. OBJECTIVE: To study the use
and outcomes of AAD therapy in anticoagulated patients with AF. METHODS:
Patients in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition
Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism
Trial in Atrial Fibrillation trial (N = 14,264) were stratified by
AAD use at baseline: amiodarone, other AAD, or no AAD. Multivariable
adjustment was performed to compare stroke, bleeding, and death across
AAD groups as well as across treatment assignment (rivaroxaban or warfarin).
RESULTS: Of 14,264 patients randomized, 1681 (11.8%) were treated with
an AAD (1144 [8%] with amiodarone and 537 [3.8%] with other AADs).
Amiodarone-treated patients were less often female (38% vs 48%), had
more persistent AF (64% vs 40%), and more concomitant heart failure
(71% vs 41%) than  were patients receiving other AADs. Patients receiving
no AAD more closely resembled amiodarone-treated patients. Time in
therapeutic range was significantly lower in warfarin-treated patients
receiving amiodarone than in those receiving no AAD (50% vs 58%; P
< .0001). Compared with no AAD, neither amiodarone (adjusted hazard
ratio [HR] 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.31; P = .9) nor
other AADs (adjusted HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.37-1.17; P = .15) were associated
with increased mortality. Similar results were observed for embolic
and bleeding outcomes. Treatment effects of rivaroxaban vs warfarin
in patients receiving no AAD were consistent with results from the
overall trial (primary end point: adjusted HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68-0.98;
Pinteraction = .06; safety end point: adjusted HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.90-1.24;
Pinteraction = .33). CONCLUSION: Treatment with AADs was not associated
with increased morbidity or mortality in anticoagulated patients with
AF. The effect of amiodarone on outcomes in patients receiving rivaroxaban
requires further investigation.

INTRODUCTION: The overall incidence of obesity and its prevalence is
increasing continuously. The obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor
whose importance is increasing too. It is associated with many chronic
conditions such as type II diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases.
The obesity is also implicated as a risk factor for several kinds of
cancer such as esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, breast cancer in
menopausal women. The treatment of the obesity may reduce the incidence
of these diseases. The mainstray of the treatment of obesity is changing
the lifestyles, but obesity s treatment may need drug therapy or even
though surgical treatment. Orlistat is a specific inhibitor of gastrointestinal
lipases, which stops fat absortion. It is used along with a hypocaloric
diet, for obesity s treatment. The beneficial effects of orlistat include
weight loss, the  improvement of blood pressure s control, it may delay
the development of diabetes mellitus, and it may reduce HbA1c. CASE
REPORT: Besides the interaction with other drugs (mainly warfarin and
amiodarone). Orlistat s mainly side effects are  gastrointestinal disorders
such as the existence of oily spotting from the rectum, abdominal pain
or discomfort, fecal urgency. There are also side effects  at other
levels, like flu symptoms, hypoglycemia, heathache or upper respiratory
infections. There are other side effects with very low incidence but
clinically relevant like pancreatitis, subacute liver failure, severe
liver disease, myopathy, or tubular necrosis secondary to oxalate nephropathy
induced by Orlistat. DISCUSSION: IN THIS CASE REPORT APPEARS A NEW
ADVERSE EFFECT OF ORLISTAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED ABOVE: thrombopenia
and macrocytic anemia.

BACKGROUND: Drug interaction studies selecting patients in a real-life
setting are scarce, and most studies to date are characterized by a
small sample size. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of amiodarone
on warfarin maintenance dose and  adverse events in an anticoagulation
cohort from a tertiary cardiovascular service. METHODS: This study
recruited 866 patients, and oral anticoagulant therapy was monitored
by the prothrombin time expressed as the international normalized ratio
(INR). Genotyping of CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 3673 polymorphisms
was performed. RESULTS: Of the 866 patients, 111 (12.8%) were taking
amiodarone and warfarin simultaneously, and 514 (59.4%) reached the
therapeutic target dose. The warfarin maintenance dose was significantly
lower in patients simultaneously using amiodarone (23.8 +/- 11.3 mg/wk)
compared with other patients (29.5 +/- 14.3 mg/wk; P < 0.001). Patients
taking amiodarone had higher INR/current dose ratios (0.83 +/- 0.04
per mg) compared with patients not  using amiodarone (0.71 +/- 0.02
per mg, P = 0.001). Adverse event frequency was not different between
the groups (P = 0.40). No genotype effect was noted on the  odds of
bleeding associated with amiodarone use. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous
use of amiodarone influences warfarin maintenance dose, but is not
associated with adverse events.
